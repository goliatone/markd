		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw this example of <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/useless_absurd_must_need_appalled_just_infuriating_essential_etc.php">poor customer service by 37signals</a> in a post recently over at Signal vs. Noise (37Signals blog).  It just puzzles me how a company that has the (in general) poor customer service that they do can get such a cult following as they have.  Honestly, the whole post reeks from their whining about having to handle what at worst could be described as "poorly worded" customer service requests.

Now, I'm willing to cut them a little slack when having to answer non-paying customers support emails.  I mean, if the user is getting a free ride, they shouldn't be complaining much unless a promised feature does not work as designed.  But even there, 37Signals doesn't say it's going to support free accounts (and I can tell you from personal experience that as a free user I've never received a response to a support request even if it was regarding broken behavior in one of their products).

Here is an example of one of the support requests that evidently they weren't impressed by:
<blockquote><strong>Very long winded</strong>
When uploading a file attached to a message shouldn't you be able to place the file into a category as you can in file management. At the moment it means you have to go into file management after posting the message and file and then edit the file into the category - very long winded.</blockquote>
The horror!  How dare a user suggest they make their product more efficient.  I don't see how they could possibly be lumping this request in with the "bad" requests they receive.  I've been on the receiving end of a helpdesk before and honestly if this was the worst (or even typical) I ever received, I would have been a happy man.  Personally my guess is the only reason this put their panties in a bunch was because a user was suggesting that they weren't being efficient enough, and from what I've seen probably generated a "pfft, they think they know how to do this better then us?" response (although luckily they were smart enough not to type that).

37Signals ... you're playing in a land of developers, get used to it.  Many of us could create the exact same products you're making, and do it just as well.  What is currently setting you ahead of the pack is your ability to come up with the idea to begin with NOT your ability to build the product or even the decisions to include or exclude particular features.

Honestly, and here comes some full disclosure for you.  I'm a former paying customer for their Backpack service.  After a bit of a blow-up in their forums, I decided to cancel my subscription and move on mostly due to the condescending nature of their staff.  It's very evident in many of their blog and forum posts that they think they know what we need better then we do.  As a developer I've been guilty of this before, but thank goodness someone usually slapped me until I came out of it.

Tangent: I was once accused in their forums (not by the staff, but by another user of the service) of having "read too many books on customer worshipping."  When I read that post I seriously thought I must have been kidnapped and taken off to la-la land.  What business can afford NOT to worship their customers?  I mean sure, if they ask you to do something that is just totally not what you do that's one thing (like asking McDonald's to wash your car), but otherwise, you should always treat your customers courteously, listen to all they have to say, and do your best to meet their needs.

Another tangent: Anyone watch Top Chef?  37Signals is to the web community what Stephen is to the other chef's on that show.

Anyhow, I'll wrap it up.  I'm just disappointed by them.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Well, after Jason Fried decided to comment on this entry, I thought I'd just look around on technorati some and see if maybe I had been taking crazy pills and the post I referenced above by 37Signals is, in fact, not so bad.  But, after a <a href="http://technorati.com/search/37signals.com%2Fsvn%2Farchives2%2Fuseless_absurd_must_need_appalled_just_infuriating_essential_etc.php">simple search on technorati</a>, I realized <a href="http://chittahchattah.blogspot.com/2006/04/appalled-indeed.html">that</a> <a href="http://www.zoliblog.com/blog/_archives/2006/4/12/1881841.html">I</a> <a href="http://jasonkolb.livejournal.com/617.html">am</a> <a href="http://needmoredesigns.com/notes/327/a-little-respect-please">not</a> <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/">the</a> <a href="http://www.socialcustomer.com/2006/04/signal_vs_noise.html">only</a> <a href="http://www.tecknik.net/poke/post.php/134">one</a> that thinks they went too far.

<strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: My friend <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=432">Jeremy decided to weigh in</a> a little bit regarding this post of mine, and I particularly like this comment of his:
<blockquote>It's said that on the internet, nobody knows you're an asshole, unless you build your business around being one.</blockquote>
If you ask me ... 37Signals has been walking really close to the line for awhile now and finally made the mistake of stepping over that line.

<strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: Yeah, I admit, I'm putting in a fair amount of effort to following this (now slowly) evolving story, but I just found <a href="http://blog.centraldesktop.com/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060413-233414">this post over at the Central Desktop Blog about it</a>.  I found a point of theirs particularly interesting:
<blockquote>It was interesting at how 37 Signal's defense was to, essentially, argue semantically about what words were actually written and said as opposed to addressing what the content of the post implied or insinuated.</blockquote>
This is exactly what they were doing and there's even a shining example down in the comments on this post (see comment from Jason Fried).  I'm also glad that they took the time to dig through the 158 comments on the post by 37Signals and found this:
<blockquote>"We're not 'ridiculing' anybody. And if you're embarrassed at seeing your support message posted publicly than maybe that's a sign that you should rephrase your support message."</blockquote>
That comment is just ... appalling to hear from a company.  The post over at Central Desktop Blog finishes with:
<blockquote>Shame on you 37 Signals. How dare you bite the very hand that feeds you?</blockquote>
This is almost exactly what I was shamed out of their forums for stating (although I had used different words).  I'm just so glad to hear I'm evidently not taking crazy pills and some other folks find this type of behavior by a company to be unsavory.  If you've been following this story, I'd definitely recommend taking the time to <a href="http://blog.centraldesktop.com/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=04&amp;entry=entry060413-233414">read their post</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The manner and tone of the original post clearly conveyed to many people that you all are becoming arrogant and probably could use a little head deflation.]]></wp:comment_content>

We quoted our customers directly.Fwiw, we don't think the requests were stupid and we do value customer feedback. We showed theses comments so people can see the different realities that exist for individual customers vs. companies vs. the customer base as a whole.  Why share this info at all? The truth is these sorts of conversations are happening all the time in companies all over. Is it better that they be hidden from the public or is it better to have an open, honest dialogue about them?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Matt, since I see you're basically copying and pasting your comments ... I'll do the same, below is my response to your nearly verbatim comment over on <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=432" rel="nofollow">Jeremy's blog</a>:<blockquote>I think it's fairly obvious, Matt, that many visitors of your website and folks across the internet saw your post as mocking your users. It's a matter of perception vs. reality and you all are trying to ignore the perception which isn't wise.  When dealing with customer service we all have times where we think bad things regarding the customers we are assisting. What good customer service teaches you however is that you need to keep those thoughts to yourself or vent them privately. Venting them in the public, as you did, is only going to land you exactly where you find yourself now -- trying to defend the indefensible because what you did was ... well, wrong. </blockquote>As for "raising an eyebrow" being dergatory or not, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.  However, I think more people would side with my opinion then yours on that matter ...]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Typical 37 Signals.  Have you ever seen them actually admit to being in the wrong, and then change their behavior because of it? Nah, they just attack you for pointing out the truth and play word games instead of realizing what a nssty attitude they have and that the person they are ridiculing might actually have a point. Above Jeremy said "It's amazing that these supposed 'new breeds' of companies can be so derisive towards their customers."  Sounds a bit like how that prior new breed (the "dotcom") didn't follow the rules of business. And we all know what happened to all but the best of them. The founders of 37 Signals have had early success as a cult of personality but because of their intense lack of maturity, they are headed for a fall once their "newness" wears off, people get tired of being treated like shit, and they start to see some real competition.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mwalters/131573149/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1/131573149_fe6d89dfca_o.jpg" border="0" alt="BlackBerry 8700c" align="left" /></a>I recently decided to purchase a <a rel="external" href="http://www.blackberry.com/products/blackberry8700/blackberry8700c.shtml">BlackBerry 8700c</a> from Cingular and felt it was time to give it a bit of a review.  So far I'm over-all pleased with the device.  <a rel="external" href="http://www.alexking.org/blog/2006/04/18/blackberry-first-impressions/">Alex King recently bought one as well</a>, it might be helpful to read his thoughts in addition to these if you're considering purchasing one.

If someone asked me whether or not I thought they should purchase the device, I would most likely respond that it's a great device, but there is no single perfect device for all users.  As with any of these types of things, it would be good to go to a store and get your hands on one so that you can decide for yourself whether it is right for you or not.  Be sure to ask plenty of questions and get the answers to them.  It's not a cheap purchase and you're going to be bummed if you spend this much money and it doesn't meet your needs.

Here are some quick lists of what I like and what I don't:
<ul>What I like:
	<li>Thumb Wheel: Man I didn't think I'd really like the whole thumb wheel thing because I'd heard some people complain about it from time to time, but if you ask me, it's what makes the device almost.  From almost anywhere in the UI you can click the thumb wheel to either execute an operation (i.e. opening an application) or use it to bring up a menu and select your option</li>
	<li>Escape Key: This is kind of hand in hand with the thumb wheel.  It's placement by the thumb wheel lends itself to one handed operation quite nicely.</li>
	<li>Internet Connection Speed: It operates on Cingular's GSM network for high-speed data transfer.  Because of this the pages load fairly quickly.  It's no broadband connection, but I'd say it could be compared to most handheld devices connected to a wifi connection.</li>
	<li>UI: I'm using the default cingular skin on mine (with some icons moved around and hidden) and find it fairly easy to navigate.  The location of items is fairly intuitive and after the first few hours with the device I don't really have to search around for anything any longer.  I like the arrangement of things as well, such as being able to see my SMS text messages, emails, open GTalk conversations, etc in the messages section</li>
	<li>GTalk: They did a pretty slick job with this.  I installed it and was up and running in no time.  It feels much like the desktop application in that you can see your buddies, their status and start conversations with them.  You can see the conversation history and when the other user is typing.  Conversations are even kept in the Messages section where your email shows up, etc (1 conversation = 1 entry in the list).</li>
	<li>"Holster Awareness": I totally love that the device knows when it's in the holster or not and the fact that you can set it to vibrate if it's in the holster, or ring if it's not.  I can't tell you how many times with my cell phone I would set it to vibrate then set it down when I got home on something like a pillow or a seat cushion and then missed calls because I couldn't hear it going off.</li>
</ul>
<ul>What I don't like:
	<li>Multiple Email Account Handling: Cingular/BlackBerry will gather email from up to 10 email accounts for you and push it to your BlackBerry.  This is alright, but as <a rel="external" href="http://www.alexking.org/blog/2006/04/18/blackberry-first-impressions/">Alex King has found</a>, it's a pain if not impossible to set up multiple from addresses when you're replying to or composing email addresses.  I've tried <a rel="external" href="http://blackberrytools.sourceforge.net/OverTheAir/">BBReply</a>, but it doesn't work on the OS Version that is running on my BlackBerry.  <strong>UPDATE</strong>: I've somewhat overcome this.  Here's a <a href="http://blog.mattwalters.net/permalink/19/">how-to for setting up BBReply on the 8700</a> that worked for me.</li>
	<li>Synchronization: Since I'm not using my BlackBerry with an Exchange server, my options to synchronize seem pretty limited.  I don't run Outlook locally or anything.  I have been using the calendar on my BlackBerry, mainly out of convenience since it's always with me, but there are definitely times where I'd prefer to set up events on my computer and just have it synch up.  Supposedly <a rel="external" href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/blackberry">Yahoo! and BlackBerry are getting together to offer tighter integration</a>, once that happens I think this point will be mostly addressed.</li>
	<li>Bluetooth with a headset: I'm thinking this might be mostly newbie error, but for some reason if I am not on a phone call and I holster my blackberry, it disconnects from my headset after a short period of time.  This is pretty annoying to be honest.  But I can't find any kind of a idle timer for the bluetooth connection or anything</li>
	<li>I find the speakerphone to only be "so-so."  If you and the person you are speaking to are in relatively quiet environments it can work nicely (I was even ok in my car with the music off).  However there was once where the person I was speaking with had a lot of background noise and the BlackBerry wouldn't turn on the mic when I spoke so they were having a lot of trouble hearing me (this seemed to be the case at least).</li>
</ul>
<ul>Here are a few quick tidbits that have helped me with the device:
	<li>Pressing Alt-Esc works much like Alt-Tab on the PC and Mac.  It's nice for moving quickly between applications</li>
	<li>You can use the "CAP" key much as a shift key which will allow you to highlight text or multiple items in a list so that you can delete/copy/paste</li>
	<li>Alt-[Thumb Wheel Click] on the home screen will allow you to move icons around or hide/unhide icons</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, as many of you probably know (from a previous review), I am a user of <a rel="external" href="http://feedlounge.com/">Feedlounge</a>.  It's my primary tool for keeping up with the ~100 websites/blogs/etc that I read.  Feedlounge decided a while back that instead of numbering their versions, they would instead name releases after their users for their suggestions, feedback, etc.  Well, last night they put out the <a rel="external" href="http://feedlounge.com/blog/2006/04/20/matt-walters-release/">"Matt Walters" Release</a>.  Anyhow, I just felt pretty honored that I was even considered for it, not to mention actually chosen.

Thanks guys, I can't wait to see what else you have in the pipe for us in future releases, and I'm going to see if I can crank out a thing or to that take advantage of the API's.  I have an idea for a WordPress Plugin/Widget as well as something that might be useful for me on <a href="http://blog.mattwalters.net/permalink/16/">my new BlackBerry</a> that will take advantage of the unread item API.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: If anyone is interested, here is a <a rel="external" href="http://api.feedlounge.com/matt/feeds/html">easily readable version of all the feeds I follow</a>.  Here is <a rel="external" href="http://api.feedlounge.com/matt/feeds/opml">an OPML</a> of the feeds.]]></content:encoded>

I&#039;m one of those people that must keep the unread count to zero.  So I check my feeds constantly and it actually bothers me when I get over 100 unread items.  So I&#039;m not sure I could take 500-600.By the way, do you have your feeds published using the new API feature?  If so I&#039;d be interested in seeing what you&#039;re reading.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of days ago a coworker shared a link to a <a rel="external" href="http://positivesharing.com/2006/03/how-not-to-lead-geeks/">blog post about how not to manage geeks</a> with me.  Then recently I saw it turn up on Digg.  I took a few moments to respond to him with what I thought in regards to the points, and thought that I might share those here as well.  I'm not going to quote EVERYTHING from the original post, so I recommend you go over and read it to see the explanation that was placed with each of these points before reading my responses below.
<blockquote>1: Downplay training</blockquote>
Eh ... I don't mind teaching myself stuff.  I actually learn better this way.  I'm willing to admit that I might very well be an exception on this though.
<blockquote>2: Give no recognition</blockquote>
Definitely important.  I personally don't need public recognition as much as just an occasional, "Hey, that was pretty sweet how you did x"
<blockquote>3: Plan too much overtime</blockquote>
Obviously this is bad.  Bad as in planning overtime is bad, not as in the point is bad.
<blockquote>4: Use management-speak</blockquote>
I personally just don't have time for people that feel they need to use the full extent of their vocabulary in every-day speak.  I've previously worked places where folks were like this a lot, and it was annoying a lot.  It's not that I can't follow the conversation, but ... get to the frickin point.
<blockquote>5: Try to be smarter than the geeks</blockquote>
AMEN!  Probably one of my favorite points on the list.  Some of the best management advice I ever heard was, "Surround yourself with people that are smarter then you.  Then listen to them."
<blockquote>6: Act inconsistent</blockquote>
Well ... I don't disagree with it, but this isn't particular to managing geeks.  Managers of all types do this.  Yes its bad, but the day I find an employer that doesn't do it ... I'll kiss their feet.  I don't think I'll be kissing feet anytime in my life, heh.
<blockquote>7: Ignore the geeks</blockquote>
Yeah, this happens.  I don't really get affected by it to be honest.  I will admit that it is a large factor in me viewing jobs as just a paycheck and nothing more though.
<blockquote>8: Make decisions without consulting them</blockquote>
Yup.  I agree.  This nearly goes hand-in-hand with point #5 if you ask me.
<blockquote>9: Don't give them tools</blockquote>
It's nice so long as the company can afford it.
<blockquote>10: Forget that geeks are creative workers</blockquote>
This is probably my favorite on the list.  I look at programming as engineering.  My Dad was/is an Industrial Engineer.  When you need to build something that's never been done before, who do you call?  Someone like him.  It's the same thing with us in web programming.  Sure, we may not be re-inventing the wheel every day, but our application of the tools we have is rarely the same any two times, and sometimes we're completely figuring it out on our own.  It is a creative process. People forget this FAR too often.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post, Matt!So I&#039;m wondering, from your perspective, this: <i>what is the proper role of management</i>?  Do they have potential to add any value to the actual production?  In what situations?  And how much of the value that they add is a result of dealing with the bloated bureaucracies within and without organizations?  Seems to me like most management positions are filled to solve the problems that other management positions create.  It&#039;s all getting towards the problems of knowledge in hierarchical orginizations, where managers are most removed from the real work but retain the lion&#039;s share of the decision making power.  Half of what I see good management doing is simply keeping day to day business concerns off the backs of the creative guys (most of those "concerns" are really nuisances caused by OTHER bureaucracies outside or inside the organization, like your HR department, OSHA, another biz making a deal with your company, etc.).  Management begets more management, because you&#039;ll never be able to get enough control and information when you separate decision making from the actual work.Perhaps in our society management is inescapable.  There&#039;s simply too much hierarchical structure (we&#039;ll set aside the possible reasons for this polarization of labor and capital).  But at least we could get rid of the unnecessary hierarchy, and put workers on more equal footing with management.  Too much decision making is done from a position of least experience and information, and that&#039;s not good for anybody.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been invited to join in an alarming number of class action lawsuits lately.  Normally I would say this is just a case of American's being law-suit happy, but honestly, given recent experiences with insane "corporate policies," poor customer service (that's putting it nicely), among other things ... it makes me wonder if this is a good commentary for the state of corporations in our country.

Large corporations are really sucking these days.  I wonder if these will teach them any lessons?  Somehow I doubt it, since most of the time it's only a slap on the wrist at best that is being sought in the suit.

And honestly, there are many small corporations that aren't doing much better then their big brothers.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think in many sectors where customer satisfaction is key, business has become far too centralized.  They're so large that these class actions are a mere fly buzzing around their heads.  With that kind of scale, how can your individual demands possibly amount to anything worth their attention, even if they WANTED to serve you the way you expect?

What we need is to shake the market up and create some windows were entrepeneurs can realize a profit in serving people like you who are disillusioned with shitty products and service for a nominally low price.  Unfortunately, these industries take huge captializations in order to ramp up to a competitive scale.  My argument that I've been advancing on my blog is that the corporations grow far beyond the scale that a normally functioning market would otherwise sustain because of government-sponsored inputs: subsidized transportation, infrastructure, limited liability, corporate personhood, etc.  This gives them the kind of staying power that makes them unwilling to take your interests seriously.

They simply don't need to in order to stay in business because things are locked up.  They realize that, yes, a competitor could expand into a threat, but it would take lots of money to do so - and any investor who'd throw that kind of money at a business would be much happier with a "stable" industry than one where competition makes profits uncertain.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just ... really hate depression.  Anyone that knows me decently knows that I have problems with it at least from time to time, and those that know me well probably realize I have problems with it pretty regularly.  It's just ... so weird.  For instance, tonight I read a blog post of Cait's, where she basically seemed to be doing really good since our break-up.  She even hinted at considering dating someone I think.  This is sort of what set off the depression for me this time.

The thoughts/feelings started as jealousy I think.  Which I quickly shut down.  I mean, she's not "mine" anymore, so I have no basis for those feelings.  I think it's just a little weird that I'm not part of her life really anymore.  It's not that I want to really ... I mean, it would just be hard for either of us to handle I think.  So anyhow, I think that led me into the depression because I started to feel sorry that I couldn't give her some of what she appears to be finding elsewhere.  It's a toss up as to whether I was unable to or whether I was unwilling to do what was necessary to give her that happiness.  Regardless, I do want those things for her.  She's an amazing person, and deserves someone that will at least try to give her everything she could ever wish for.

I don't think the fact that I started becoming depressed over this is so much what bothers me, as much as the fact that I didn't try to do anything about it.  In fact, looking back at the moments and movements I just went through, I actually fed the depression, as though I didn't want to stop being depressed, like I wanted to just wallow in it or something.  I mean ...

- I stood up and turned off the room light
- I turned off the TV
- I turned on music and immediately started skipping songs ... only to stop on a "sad" song
- Was talking to a friend on IM, and I basically went silent
- Stopped reading the feeds I was reading ... stopped reading the websites I was reading ...

... I basically helped myself completely shut down.

In a bit of a different direction then where I was going with that ... I guess I wonder if it does boil down to an issue of jealousy.  I mean, I'm glad that I was able to get out of her way so she could be happy, because I don't think I was going to be able to give her what she wanted, but ... I wonder if it's just that I'm jealous of the fact that she does seem to be ... becoming happy, and that's something that always seems to evade me.  Anyhow ...

It's sort of weird, something else I noticed about myself that is.  The other day, I sort of said to myself, "ya know, I'm just not having much luck with the whole social/relationship thing, maybe I should just focus on my career since I do seem to be making some success for myself in that area."  First of all, I'm kind ofembarrassed that I had that thought / conscious decision.  Secondly though, and perhaps a more important realization, is that I've actually started going out more, and doing more.  It's like I somehow released myself of the "pressure" I had been putting myself under, which had basically incapacitated me to the point where I was basically doing nothing socially.  The only problem there are nights like tonight ... where I've now locked myself in my room and am feeling sorry for myself.

Like the title says ... argh.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Figured I'd just note that I got promoted at my job today to the position of Web Development Manager.  I'm pretty excited about it and looking forward to the opportunities and challenges it's going to present me with.  Anyhow, I'll make this brief to keep with my whole "I don't talk about work" philosophy on my blog, heh.  Just thought some of you might like to know.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While I talk a lot specifically about <em><a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a></em> in this post, I am speaking more broadly about a certain series format on TV, and the problems with that format.

Close to a year ago now, I started watching <em>Lost</em>.  It was already into its second season, but my roomie had bought the first season on DVD, so I decided to watch it to see what everyone was talking about.  I was almost instantly hooked and within a week or less, I had finished watching the entire season.  I think they were 13-14 episodes into season 2 by the time I finished season 1.  I decided to buy those episodes from iTunes, quickly caught up, and was then watching it as the episodes aired on TV.  We're now 6 episodes into season 3, and I haven't missed a single episode for the entire series.

Near the end of season 2, I started to lose my love (or perhaps infatuation) for the series.  So little was being revealed, and I've grown to loathe the flashback mechanism that they use in EVERY episode, taking up half of the episode pretty much and doing nearly nothing to move the main plot lines forward.  So little has actually been revealed, and what worries me is that some of the things I consider still unanswered, the writers have said they consider to be wrapped up.  Without giving anything away in case you like watching the show and aren't up to date, those 'answers,' as the writers call them, are anything but answers.

There are other series now following this general format (not really the flashbacks thank goodness, but the killer levels of suspense in every episode) and that worries me somewhat, at least with the current way things are done.  Some examples being <em><a href="http://www.nbc.com/NBC_First_Look/Heroes/">Heroes</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/">Jericho</a></em>, etc.

So what's the point of my post you ask?

Well, what I'd really like to see the networks do is contract these series, and then hold to it.  I don't mean contracts for seasons like they have now, I mean the whole series.  In other words, they should say, "Ok, <em>Lost</em> writers, we think this could be successful for 5 seasons, so work out all of your story arch's, realizations, etc within that time."  After 5 seasons, the series is ended, and all is well.  The folks watching the series should feel at least most of the questions asked in the series were answered, and feel some closure after the series finale.  Think of it as a real long mini-series, with a definitive beginning and ending.  The problem I see with the current way things are done is that the writers never know when they're going to need to finish things up, so they either end up doing it quickly and poorly, or they never get the chance to do it at all.

I forget where I heard it, or if it's even true, but I remember at some point being told that many times, series are not given true endings because the networks never know if they might want to come back and make a made for TV movie later or whatever, but really, that's just silly.  What's the last TV series you can think of where after it was all over, someone went back and made a movie for it (and the movie wasn't a mistake to make).  One point to make here, because I know some of my friends, but <a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/">Serenity</a> doesn't count for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a>, what Fox did to that show was just wrong.

I really wish an idea like this could take hold.  I think we'd start seeing some great TV series show up on TV, and I'd venture a guess that DVD sales for series based on this format would at least meet if not exceed DVD sales for current/past series.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I finally went ahead and got a Wii (<a title="AlexKing.org - Wii" href="http://alexking.org/blog/2007/01/23/wii" target="_blank">Alex's post</a>, and talking to <a title="Pat" href="http://doiexist.com/" target="_blank">Pat</a> finally tipped me towards getting one).  I had been talking about it on and off for a little while now.  I must admit that I'm pretty impressed with it, from it having built-in WiFi, to the precise/sensitivity of the controls, it's great.  As others have been saying, it can give you a workout as well.  So far I only have the games it comes with (Wii Sports), but they're pretty fun.  I'd have to say that boxing is my favorite so far, although I'm pretty decent at bowling on it.

Anyhow, if you've been sitting on the fence about whether to get one or not, so far given my experience with it, I'd have to say go get one.  It's something to kill time with / have fun with, and mild exercise at worst ;)

I'll try to post some more about it after I've had some time to play with some of the other features like internet connectivity and other games.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had a little more time to play around with the Wii now and was able to pick up a few extra games this afternoon for it.  I'm still very pleased with it, and really surprised by some of its features.  Here are some of my thoughts about the console and the games I purchased.

<strong>Console</strong>
The WiFi connectivity is nice.  I was wondering if I was going to have to run another CAT5 cable towards my TV or get a hub or something (I already have 1 line running to my TiVo).  So it was nice to find out that it had WiFi built in.  I had a little bit of trouble with it losing its connection, but then I saw <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2007/01/23/wii#comment-54066" target="_blank">this comment</a> on Alex's blog which recommended changing the router up to channel 11.  This seems to have fixed the connectivity issues that I was having, that or the Wii got used to my network, either way it doesn't seem to fall off anymore.  I will admit I was a little surprised to see that it didn't have a built in DVD player (like the PS2, etc), but I guess their disc's might be in a different format or something.  It's built in photo-viewer (which will read images off the SD card you can put into the console) works decently, it's nothing special but it's not bad either.  The controls are great.  I was concerned that they just wouldn't feel natural for a gaming system, but I was very wrong.

So far from what I've seen, there doesn't seem to be much of a way to play with friends over the Internet, but I haven't had time to really investigate it, and if someone comes across this post that has more details on this, please let me know as I'd be pretty excited to be able to do this.

<strong>Wii Sports</strong>
This is the set of games that comes packaged with the Wii. It includes Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, Golf, and Boxing.  So far I've mostly been enjoying Boxing, Tennis, and then Bowling/Golf.  I really just started playing Tennis late this afternoon, but it's quickly becoming my favorite game of the set.  Boxing is good, but the punches just aren't quite fast enough in-game for what I'm throwing in real life. As for Golf, I've never actually played real golf, but it's a fun game to sort of relax and play.  You do have to keep control of your speed though, what I'd consider a "real" golf swing goes off the meter in the game.  Baseball is tough, all you're really doing is either hitting or pitching.  Pitching on it is extremely easy, and hitting is extremely tough.  Swinging at just the right time to not hit a foul ball is next to impossible for me.  Although I will say that Baseball is a great example of seeing just how in tune the controller is with your hand movements.  You hold it just like a bat and if you bring it back like you're about to swing, then do that wobble thing that you always see batters do, you can see the bat in the game follow your movements, it's great/impressive.

<strong>WarioWare: Smooth Moves</strong>
Honestly, this game is just sort of silly. It's actually a slew of mini games.  However, it is good for something that won't tax your brain, and it gets you used to all the different ways you can use the controller(s).

<strong>Rayman Raving Rabbids</strong>
Complete insanity. Raving Rabbids somewhat reminds me of WarioWare: Smooth Moves in that it's somewhat mini-games (although not quite as mini as WarioWare).  Some of them are somewhat challenging from a coordination perspective, some are completely simplistic, and some just make you laugh so hard it's difficult to complete the "mission."  I'm glad I purchased it though, it's good fun.

<strong><a title="ZeldaTWP" name="ZeldaTWP"></a>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</strong>
I was really worried that I'd end up regretting having purchased this game. I haven't owned a Nintendo since the original NES (and the only system I've owned between the NES and my Wii is a PS2 which I rarely ever play), but I have played some of the Zelda variations through the years on friends systems.  I haven't liked any of them since the original Zelda on NES (even if it's graphics were horrible by today's standards).  All that being said though, I am REALLY enjoying this game.  I put it in figuring that I might play for a few minutes and then go back to some Wii Sports ... about 3-4 hours later, I was still playing it.  It's not overly action packed (at least with how far I've been able to get into it so far) but it's neat getting to swing a sword around, do some quests (yes, I'm one of the geeks that had multiple high level characters on EverQuest and World of Warcraft before quitting, so I can get into the questing stuff).  I can't quite put my finger on it exactly, but something about this game really intrigues me and makes me want to keep playing to see "what's next."

Whelp, time for me to get back to playing some more ;)  My arms are already sore, I'm sure that'll feel good tomorrow, hehe.]]></content:encoded>

As we were playing, we joked about the stories of the Wii controller slipping out of ones hands and breaking the television.  We then tried the Tennis game and discovered that the Wii can cause other damage.  As my friend was showing off his tennis skills with a rocking backhand, the cat got in the way and went flying from a shot to the chops from the Wii controller.  The cat is ok, but another funny disclaimer that should be added to the machine, BEWARE THAT Wii MAY HURT ANIMALS!]]></wp:comment_content>

Anyhow, I definitely recommend it, and if you do play and complete it, make sure to watch all the way through the end (I almost got up after I saw the credits start and there was still some story left to go).

Thought I'd share, heh.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I decided to sign up for Google App's to see how I liked it.  So far playing around with it has been nice.  I have my email setup there and am slowly getting contacts added for GTalk.  It's also neat since you can do some simple customizations like adding you're own logo.

This actually came at a pretty good time hopefully.  I had been searching for a calendar option somewhat, and Google Calendar is pretty decent for my purposes, so having my email and calendar all wrapped up together will do nicely. I was also able to move some of my common documents I like to have floating around with me (such as my resume) moved over to my Documents.  It's not MS-Office (that's not really meant as a compliment to MS), but it'll do well for my purposes.  It may not all be as robust, but it has the features that I need most commonly.  I should be able to figure things out for the other times.I'll let you know how things go.  Let's just hope that <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2006/03/20/gmail-gtalk-gfailure/">my old problems</a> don't return, heh.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mattwalters.net/Images/Misc/Samsung_Blackjack.gif" border="0" alt="Samsung Blackjack" width="211" height="363" align="left" />I purchased a Samsung BlackJack recently (just yesterday in fact).  I suppose my thoughts on it are somewhat limited for the time being, but hopefully I'll be able to write up a more thorough review eventually.

So far I'm very impressed though.  Most of the people that I first told about my purchase immediately responded with either "the battery life sucks" or "you'll have to tell me what you think of the battery life."  So far ... not really seeing what they're talking about.  For one thing, the phone comes with two batteries (one normal and one extended life) and an external charger so you can charge whichever isn't currently in your phone.  To some extent the fact that the phone comes with two batteries would seem to strengthen their implications, but still, unless the phones battery life starts really nose diving over time, it's doing good for me still after 24 hours (on the extended life battery).

I think my charging habits might be a little different then most folks though.  I tend to plug my phone in to let it charge every night while I sleep, so a phone has to have a super short battery life in order to bug me (less then one day of normal use).  But anyhow, I can write more reliable information on the battery at another time.

Getting up and running on the phone has been a breeze.  I'm having a much easier time then I was with my <a title="BlackBerry 8700c" href="http://mattwalters.net/2006/04/19/blackberry-8700c/">BlackBerry 8700c</a>. With the BlackBerry, which I still consider a great device, it was pretty difficult to get any sort of decent calendar snyc'ing or tethering going on if you didn't have an Exchange account, and it was just recently that you were able to change your reply-to address on outgoing emails (on a per-email basis that is).

With the BlackJack, I have access to POP3 and IMAP email (which is nice) and can take advantage of the Push service (offered by Cingular) for my GMail account.  I was also able to use <a href="http://thegooley.wordpress.com/2006/12/13/gcalendarsync-v02-release-source/">GCalendarSync</a> to sync up my Google Calendar (bi-directional sync over the air).  So it's almost Exchange-like as far as my email and calendar functions go now.

I was also able to quickly get setup for tethering my MacBook and BlackJack, allowing me to connect to the Internet via my phone.  This was another issue I had with the BlackBerry that lead to me participating in <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2006/10/16/blackberry-bounty-winner">Alex King's BlackBerry Bounty</a>.  If you stumble across this post while trying to figure out how to tether your BlackJack and MacBook, I used <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/12/14/how-to-tether-a-samsung-blackjack-to-get-your-mac-online/">this post</a> and <a href="http://mobilitytoday.com/news/007194/blackjack_mac_connection">this one</a> to figure it out.

After getting the tethering up, and email/calendar, I looked for a good way to bring my contacts from GMail over to it (which I had spent a decent amount of time de-dup'ing and formatting, etc).  This (and some other snyc'ing concerns) led me to find <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_windowsmobile.php">The Missing Sync for WindowsMobile</a>. After exporting my Contacts from GMail (in Outlook format) I was able to import them into my MacBooks Address Book.  I had to do a little further formatting because of how GMail stores names as one field, but that was easy.  Anyhow, once they were in my Address Book, I was able to use The Missing Sync to sync up my contacts to my BlackJack (the program sync's other items on the device as well).  After that, I was up and fully running.

All things considered (Internet searches, dead ends, etc) I probably spend 2.5-3 hours getting all of that setup the way I wanted it.  I'm now very happy with my device and it's chugging along nicely for me.  I don't think that's bad at all.

Anyhow, I'll try to get more into my thoughts on the interface and input mechanisms (I'm so glad it has a thumb-wheel like the BlackBerry) in a later post, as well as revisit the battery life topic.  I definitely think some more time will need to be spent with the device to really figure that out.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Upgrade WordPress to 2.1.2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, after reading <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212/">the security upgrade</a> release (you should upgrade now, especially if you installed 2.1.1 in the past 3-4 days) of WordPress, I decided it was time to go ahead and switch over to updating via SVN.  I think this is really going to make my updates (and new installations in the future) a lot easier and I'm glad I finally took the time to look into it.  If you're interested in switching over to this setup as well, there are <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion">instructions for installing/upgrading WordPress via SVN</a> over at WordPress Codex (you'll need to change out some version numbers to make sure to get the latest, etc, but it'll work nicely if you do that).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is part 2 of my <a title="Samsung Blackjack Review" href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/02/28/samsung-blackjack/">Samsung Blackjack review</a>.  So I've now had a little more time to play with my Blackjack and overall I'm still impressed.  I think I've spent enough time with it now to be able to speak more towards the battery life and UI.   So ... let's get started.

<strong>Battery Life</strong>
I can definitely understand why folks were making the comments that they were in regards to the battery life.  It's a good thing that it comes with two batteries.  The standard battery that it comes with is probably at best a back-up battery.  I let it charge over night and then gave it what I'd call average use throughout the next day.  I probably spent about 30 minutes on phone calls during the day, and occasionally checked out things in the mobile browser, it also was keeping my email and calendar sync'd.  That evening, I had to make a call where I was placed on hold for awhile (total time on the call probably 30-45 minutes) and then the battery went dead on me.  I did realize afterwards that I had left blue-tooth on all day, so I'm sure that drained the battery faster, but still, I was a bit surprised that it didn't last at least the full day.  Since then, I've been using the extended-life battery that came with the phone and battery life hasn't been an issue for me.  It has a 3 bar battery indicator and it usually still has 2 bars left when I plug it in to charge at night.  I haven't been leaving blue-tooth on either (I always forget my headset anyhow).  I do make sure to carry the other battery with me just in case I need it for some reason, it's small enough that it slides easily into my bag.

<strong>Input</strong>
Well, as I stated in my last post, I'm very glad that it has the thumb-wheel and escape button like the BlackBerry's do.  This definitely made converting over pretty simple, not to mention it's a great navigation tool for devices like this (at least if you're right-handed I suppose).  As for the keyboard, it does fine but it's not as good as the BlackBerry's was.  I actually blame this on the shape of the keys more then the layout of special-characters and punctuation.  Sometimes it seems to miss keystrokes, not often, but just enough to be noticeable.  The Missing Sync has been great for keeping my contacts consolidated and helping me transfer files to the device (I just got my 2GB Micro-SD card for it).  I also like that you can tell the phone how you want it to act when plugged into a USB port on your computer.  You can specify that you want it to connect for sync'ing, to act as a mass storage device or that you want it to connect as a modem.  That's pretty spiffy if you ask me.

<strong>UI</strong>
The UI is working for me for the most part.  It does seem to go "quirky" on me at times though causing me to cycle the phone off/on.  For some reason the mobile browser will act up sometimes and basically return nothing on web requests.  Rebooting seems to be the only way to get it back to working.  This seems to affect my calendar sync'ing and email pushing (which leads me to believe it's actually just polling quickly) as well.

Windows Mobile definitely has some ground to make up when compared to the BlackBerry.  It's not really bad, but RIM got it right.  Their core applications and functionality seem to be "hardened" and continue to respond quite well despite any silliness that running applications might try to do.  Windows Mobile doesn't protect itself as well it would seem.  But the applications that do come on the device work fairly well.

I especially like the home screen.  It shows my upcoming calendar events and gives me a look-at-a-glance view of SMS, email, etc.  There are roughly 5 icons across the top.  Several icons always stay easy-to-access like contacts and the calendar.  The rest cycle through recently opened applications.  You can also hold in the thumb-wheel from the home screen to get quick access to things like alarms, the Task Manager (to stop applications for example), etc.  It makes a decent attempt at expecting what the user might want to do as well with the soft keys.  The left always stays as the "Start" button (so many other words that would work better there ...), the right generally will take you to your contacts listing, but if you just received an SMS txt for instance it will change to take you directly to your messages.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Overall I'm pleased with the device.  It is doing a good job at providing the services I wanted it to.  When compared to the BlackBerry it's a rough comparison.  Device alone, I think the BlackBerry might be a better device, but when it comes to sync'ing email, calendar, contacts, so far the Blackjack has been easier for me to get running on, as well as tethering it to my MacBook, and it's good enough on the other stuff to not make you long for your BlackBerry.  So I guess it really comes down to your needs and whether the battery life is acceptable to you.  If you're the type of person traveling a lot and not able to plug your phone in once a day, the Blackjack is probably not the device for you (you can charge it off a USB connection to your computer if that makes any difference though).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Great Albums</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My friend, Jeremy, had a good idea and <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=654">listed 5 albums that "meant a lot" to him</a>.  Not, "these are the best albums ever," nor, "these are my all time favorites."  Just simply, five great albums, and he asked others to share.  I briefly did so in his comments, but thought I'd put a few more moments into it here.  So this is my list, based on the same basic criteria and in no particular order and just for fun, how I discovered them:
<ul>
	<li>The Killers - Hot Fuss: <a href="http://doiexist.com/">Pat</a> introduced me to this one, I've listened to this for hours and hours.</li>
	<li>Ben Lee - Awake is the New Sleep: I was evaluating whether I wanted XM Radio or not, listening from their website and Gamble Everything for Love came on, one of the few times I've liked one song enough to go buy the whole album.  Lucky for me I enjoyed the rest of the album just as much.</li>
	<li>Pink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon: Ross, my brother, has definitely influenced my music listening over the years.  One weekend I went to visit him while he was in college (I was in high school) and he bought me Dark Side and Pulse (great live Pink Floyd album).  Then either that weekend or soon after, me, him, and a friend of his, Scott, listened to the album straight through (only way to do it).  I've been hooked ever since.</li>
	<li>Neil Young - Harvest: This is another case of Ross influencing my music taste.  He'd told me I would probably like Neil young, so one night I borrowed my step-dad's CD of Decade.  Been enjoying  Neil Young ever since.</li>
	<li>Son Volt - Trace: Jeremy and I used to be in a band with a guy named Nick.  Jeremy had heard of Son Volt before but Nick mentioned them one night and let me borrow this CD.</li>
</ul>
Like I said, I won't try to argue for these being the best five ever, and I'd probably re-arrange them forever even if I just called it my favorite list.  But they are all albums that at some point in my life I've spent a great deal of time listening to, and have usually revisited time after time.

Along with Jeremy, I won't be tagging anyone either, but if you care to share some of yours, I'd love to hear it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U-Haul has awful customer service</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pretty mad about my whole experience with U-Haul at the moment.  So I'll simply show the letter I am sending to their contact forms and mailing off as soon as I can locate their corporate office address:
<blockquote>In short, your customer service is horrible.

On Sunday, March 25th, I placed an order/reservation on your website for 1 17' Truck, 1 dolly, 1 hand truck, 10 small boxes, 10 medium boxes, and 10 large boxes.  Later that afternoon I received a call from a local U-Haul.  The lady on the phone confirmed my truck reservation date and pick up time.  I asked her if she knew how I would go about getting my boxes.  She said, "the internet orders, I don't know.  We don't know how that works."  I sort of chuckled to myself, remembering my customer service training where I was taught that "I don't know" is never an acceptable response to a customer, but simply said, "ok," figuring I could call the toll-free number on my internet receipt and get things straightened out.  So today, March 27th, I call the 888 number located on the bottom of my receipt.  They tell me that they didn't have any record of my order for boxes, but if I took in my internet print-out, I could pick them up at any local U-Haul location.  So I went to do just that.  I figured I would go to the location that had confirmed my truck reservation.

I arrive at the storefront and track down someone to help me (the store was completely empty).  She tells me that she's not sure, but seems to be willing to help out.  So she calls, as best as I can tell, the regional office, I later heard her refer to it as "Traffic."  She does this on the speakerphone.  The lady on the phone tells her to allow me to pick up my boxes, and they hang up.  Then she calls the number right back and says she didn't understand how that would work.  Since I wasn't giving her money, it would look like 30 boxes had disappeared from her inventory.  That made sense to me, at least to ask the question.  The lady on the phone says that she had asked someone else in the office and they said the same thing.  The lady in the store asked if she could speak to a supervisor, but they had all gone home.  The lady in the store calls another number and speaks to someone else who tells her my card hadn't been charged, but they didn't exchange any reference numbers or anything, the guy she was speaking to knew nothing about my specific order, and I was standing there with a sheet of paper that showed the dollar amounts and showed an amount that it said would be billed to my card.  She tells me to get anything further done I'll need to call 1-800-GO-UHAUL.  So I left to do that from my car.

While sitting in my car, on hold waiting for a representative, a gentleman comes out of the storefront and tells me that in the store they would like to speak to me on a conference call.  So I go back in and am put on the phone with what I later find out is the 888 number at the bottom of my receipt.  She looks up my reference number and says she has no record of the boxes.  I asked her, "Well I'm standing here with a piece of paper that shows the whole order, so what do I need to do?"  Her response was, "I've done my job."  I almost lost it.  If I had not been in your storefront I can assure you, that she would have had a new orifice by the time I was done with her.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, she said she was the supervisor.  I told her that I wanted to speak with a manager or someone above her and she said that would not be possible.  I told her that just won't work and that I was getting led in circles and that something needed to be done to straighten this situation out, and that I couldn't believe this was all going on.  She responded, "I'm sorry you feel that way."

So I leave the store again to call the number on my print-out.  It's the same lady from the paragraph above.  I told her to transfer me to someone that could do something to help me.  I'm assuming at this point that she transferred me to 1-800-GO-UHAUL.  I get a representative on the phone and tell him that "I am having trouble with an order/reservation and that I'm having a very bad experience with Customer Service."  I explain the story up to the present with him and he tells me I need to speak with the regional office first.  I ask for his supervisor and he says I need to go through the chain of command.  I told him with all the circles I had been put through that that was ridiculous.  We finally argue down to the point that I asked him for the number because he said he couldn't transfer me to the number (funny since he later transferred me to a different number).  Once he's given me the number I realize it is the same 888 number that was on my printout.  He sort of stops and places me on hold for a minute or two.  Then comes back but doesn't say anything, as I can hear the other customer service rep's trying to get what I assume are other customers to also call the regional office.  Then I hear the phone go back to being on hold for another minute or so.  Then he comes back on the line and says he'll transfer me to someone who can assist me.

I get on the phone with that person and they tell me that my card hasn't been charged and that I would need to go into the U-Haul store and purchase the boxes.  At that point I was just livid.  I couldn't even take it anymore.  I had been standing in the parking lot of one of your storefronts for 45-60 minutes and I'd had enough.  So I went back in the store and purchased the boxes, figuring that if I later see a charge from you on my credit card I'll demand a refund or dispute the charge and file a charge-back.

I have most definitely had bad customer service experiences in the past, and I'm certain that I'll have more in the future, but I cannot recall another time where within a confined time period I had the same business tell me:
- I don't know
- I've done my job
- There's nothing more I can do
- You'll have to talk to so-and-so at this number, and no I can't transfer you

This is completely insane.  I can't wait for my move to be over, I only wish I could say it was out of excitement for the move.  Unfortunately at this point, it is largely so I can put behind me having to deal with such poor customer service.  As I've said, in my training through the years I've learned that "I don't know" is not an acceptable response, and that displeased customers are more likely to tell a larger number of people about their poor experience then a customer which had a good experience.  I can assure you, that I will gladly explain my experience to anyone I have the opportunity to, and give them detailed reasons as to why they should NOT use U-Haul.  At this point I am hoping that I can locate another truck company and cancel my U-Haul reservation.  There is NO excuse for me to have had this experience.</blockquote>
Update: Well, I received a call from the local U-Haul manager today (for the store I had visited).  She apologized in all kinds of ways for my experience, but didn't seem to know the answer to my original question either (whether I should have been able to just pick up my boxes, or they were being shipped to me).  She did give me her name and told me when she would be in over the next week or so, and told me that if I was double charged or needed something further, that I should give her a call.

When I got home this evening, I had 2 boxes full of boxes waiting for me.  It turns out my card had been charged and they had shipped them to me.  This is a great service for moving, but frustrating that <strong>at all levels of Customer Service I spoke to, no one knew this was how the operation worked</strong>, and not only did they not know, bust some <strong>INSISTED that my card had not been charged and I needed to still purchase the boxes.</strong>

Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to speak with the manager again and if I can have it "my way," I'll go for taking the shipped boxes and my receipt from yesterday in and have them just refund yesterdays purchase.  If that or something really close to it doesn't happen ... well, you can expect another rant here I imagine.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow I turn 28 ... or is it 29, er 27 maybe?

Funny little story for you ... one day while working at Capital One (one of my first days actually), one of my coworkers asked how old I was.  I hadn't really answered this question for quite sometime, and as sad as it sounds, I had forgotten.  I sat there, trying not to studder, realizing I was talking to some insanely intelligent people, my mind started racing.  I was thinking, "Ok, I was born in '79 it's now 2001," or whatever year it was, "so ... borrow from the 0, the other 0, the 2.  Wait, wait, this is taking too long, it's 21 years from 79 ti 2000, then add 1, or is it 2, is it before or after April?"  Then I realized I was taking entirely too long to answer the question, so I just blurted out, "23."  I had no clue if I'd just provided the correct age, but I knew I was in the ballpark.  I felt so stupid.  After I got back to my desk I actually figured it out and realized I had given the correct age.  Phew.

Whoever said computer nerds are smart and good at math ... well, they obviously haven't met me.

For the record, I will be 28. Ever since the above incident I've tried to do a better job at remembering my own age.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, it's about time I admitted to it.  I am addicted ... to gadgets.  It's entirely out of control, here are some of my purchases over the past year or so:
<ul>
	<li>HP Pavilion dv1000 Laptop</li>
	<li>WiFi Sniffer: Not just a simple key fob one, this one has a display that tells me if the network is open, etc</li>
	<li>Maxtor 250GB External USB Hard Drive</li>
	<li>Motorola RAZR Cell Phone</li>
	<li>Bluetooth Headset</li>
	<li>TomTom Vehicle GPS/Navigation System</li>
	<li>XM Radio</li>
	<li>PlayStation 2</li>
	<li>the list continues although it is smaller purchases from this point on...</li>
</ul>
Don't get me wrong, for the most part I really like most of the purchases I've made (only real exception I see in the list is the PS2).  The RAZR is great, and it's kind of cool because like I can hook it into my laptop for instance and use it to connect to the internet if I can't find a WiFi spot, or my TomTom system can grab control of it and get Weather &amp; Traffic information.  So for the most part I don't regret the purchases, but ... wow.  It's not like my life couldn't go on without any of the above.  I think what really bugs me about it is that in general it's expensive stuff, heh.

It just doesn't seem to have an end.  I'm now having to hold myself back from getting a blackberry.  Do I really need one?  Not especially, I mean, I'd replace my RAZR with it if I were to buy one.  It would be nice to use it for email, txt'ing etc (due to the thumb keyboard) while I'm out and about.  But honestly, what I probably really need in my life right now is to become more disconnected rather then connected to the internet.

... must ... stop ... purchasing ... gadgets ... *sigh*

<strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Oh, I forgot these on the list above:
<ul>
	<li>Nikon D100</li>
	<li>Professional Flash</li>
	<li>50mm, 18-70mm, 100-200mm lenses</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to go ahead and adopt a cat this weekend.  I'd been thinking about it for awhile, just finally figured it was time to just do it.  Meet Cadbury:

<a title="Cadbury" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/tags/cadbury/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/205/487361998_414c3e3deb.jpg" alt="Cadbury" width="500" height="333" /></a>I got her from the Richmond SPCA.  She's very sweet.  You can click on the above image for more pictures of her. She's been cracking me up most of the weekend.  I made sure to go out and get some toys for her and all the stuff you need to take care of a cat before I brought her home.  When I first got her here, she spent a good while hiding under my bed.  I eventually brought her out and she sat in my lap for a bit, then returned to under the bed.  But a couple hours later she ventured out on her own and started to explore the apartment.  It took her about 24 hours to start eating, but the SPCA said it wasn't uncommon for them to take 2-3 days to start eating, so I figure that's pretty good.

She's definitely clinging onto me some, and I've been giving her lots of attention.  It sort of makes me laugh because when I walk around the apartment she heels me almost like a trained dog might, heh.  And when I'm watching TV in the living room, she definitely feels a need to sit in my lap and watch or curl up and go to sleep.  As I type this she's sitting in the chair with me, to my side, laying on her back sleeping.  Too funny.

Anyhow, thought I'd share :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(Fair warning, if you aren't a nerd, you might want to skip this post)

Are we (programmers, developers, engineers) still really having these debates?  Give me a break.  Java vs. .NET, Java vs. PHP, .NET vs. PHP, now Ruby on Rails vs. PHP.

The other day, <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/15/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-2" target="_blank">sent</a> <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/16/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-3" target="_blank">me</a> <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/5/21/hi-i-m-ruby-on-rails-part-4" target="_blank">these</a>.  They're a series of videos created by Ruby on Rails fans, basically comparing PHP vs. Rails.  I watched the videos and told Jeremy something along the lines of, "they're funny, but they're not really a valid comparison of the languages."  I'll be honest, I'm too lazy to look up his initial response, but at some point he told me, "they're entirely valid comparisons."

My main point was that if you only compare based on what the video's show, PHP is capable of doing everything Rails is, although the videos, if you knew nothing about the two languages, would lead you to believe that wasn't the case.  I conceded the point that at least to some extent, Rails would win when it comes to Migrations.  But even that, you can mimic in some way for PHP, but it might not be QUITE as easily done.  You can, without much trouble in fact, abstract your database from your code, you can do MVC,  you can do OOP (in fact PHP5 has greatly extended OOP in PHP).

Then I allowed myself to be pulled into the language vs. language debate (although he will most likely claim that somehow we weren't having a language vs. language debate).  It was all quite silly ... on both sides if I'm being entirely honest.

I like the fact that PHP will let me put together a quick script without having to go through MVC/OOP/etc etc if that's all I want to do.  I like that it doesn't make assumptions about how I'm going to set things up, I also like that if I want to get very structured, or even apply a framework, I can.  He believes that the fact that Rails forces (force is my word, he would most likely say it just makes a certain way so easy why would you choose another) you into a structure is a plus for the language/framework.  He even went on to say/imply that a language that didn't force that was inferior.

Some of the silliness came in to play later.  For instance I think some of the helpers and whatnot available in Rails, while lowering the entrance barrier for new programmers, also create lazy programmers that don't actually know how things are actually being done, or why it is being done that way.  It was silly because earlier in the discussion I had argued that just because PHP allows sloppy code to be written, doesn't mean the language is at fault, the programmer is at fault.  I still don't really back off of either of my points, I guess that line is just a little fuzzy for me.  But I will admit that I could see how me arguing it one direction in one instance then flipping could be seen as odd.

Then later he made the comment that one of the problems in our discussions was we were comparing PHP (the language) to Rails (a framework).  That being silly because everything up to that point, and past that point was and continued to be comparing PHP to Rails.  Somewhere along the lines I asked if we were comparing PHP to Ruby or PHP to Ruby on Rails.  Because if we were comparing PHP to Ruby, the videos were just nonsense.  If we were comparing to Rails then we'd need to introduce Cake or Code Igniter on the PHP side, which would again make the videos invalid.  He, in some fashion, agreed.  Not sure why we continued from there, but we did.

He argued that the great thing about working within the framework and doing things the easiest/forced way was good for when picking up projects from others.  My opinion is, you can easily setup standards and processes to create maintainable code within your organization regardless of your chosen language.  So that leaves us with having to deal with picking up projects from outside developers.  If you think that enough development firms are going to pick up one language so that when acquiring projects from another development firm that it will be easier because it's written in your language, you're living in a dream world.

Somewhere he brought up that he thinks PHP programmers are eventually going to go the way of the mainframe programmer, using COBOL as an example.  Honestly, one day, that will probably be the case, but good grief that is a premature statement.  There are organizations that would label PHP as cutting edge (I wouldn't agree, but regardless, me myself and I are not the majority), not to mention the large number of large sites running PHP (Wikipedia, Digg, Facebook just to name a few), and Yahoo's involvement in the community.  I would say PHP is still growing, if not exploding.  It's hardly the time to be making funeral arrangements.

So anyhow, I think I'm done ranting about this, but needed to throw it out there.  Just to be clear, I think Ruby and Ruby on Rails are great.  I consider them powerful tools for development and have not and will not ever consider someone silly for wanting to learn them, nor will I think that my tool-set (PHP + framework or no framework) are somehow superior. I know the language vs. language debate is not going to end here and now.  It never will.  But, GAH!  I'm sick of it.  Use what you want to use.  User experience is what ultimately matters and they're all capable of providing similar if not exactly alike experiences.  Anyone who disagrees with that needs to come out of their cave.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Allow me a defense :)First of all, I still think the commercials point out entirely valid comparisons, but I always stipulated that the were comparsions of the experiences of the majority of coders.  There's a bit of a selection bias here because, since the commercials were made for RailsConf specifically, the audience was by definition already convinced that Rails solved problems endemic to real-world PHP programming.  Yes, there are PHP frameworks out there, but they just aren't used that often.  I kept coming back to the point that Rails was a response to a particular climate, not just a language or competing framework.  We both agree that this response has merit, I thinkI never said a language that didn't enforce certain behavior was inferior.  I said that you were pigeonholing Rails as a "structured" approach that forced you to do stuff you didn't want to do, which is flat out wrong.  Part of the problem here is that Ruby is a very different language than either you or I are used to.  The expressiveness it allows enables all sorts of things we'd never think to do or would think to difficult to do in other languages.  I'm thinking specifically of modifying class definitions on the fly, the variety of ways to perform iteration, closures, etc.  These are "next level" language features that make any design decisions of the Rails framework much less binding than in other language/framework packages.  That would almost certainly apply to ANY framework built in Ruby.There will always be lazy programmers.  Rails encourages laziness in the initial stages of writing an app, no doubt.  But the need to understand how to write code is not, therefore, rendered moot, but rather deferred to such time a you can't CRUD your way to a youtube or twitter.  Keep in mind that this is totally in line with Agile philosophy - you do the work when it becomes necessary, not ahead of time.It boggles my mind that a guy who uses so much open source code would not give more weight to the advantages of a consistently understood framework.  It's not just for enterprises picking up projects from other firms; it's new team members.  It's ad-hoc plugin development ecosystems.  It's having a standard that can serve as a jumping off point for real, critical discussions (even ones that demonstrate Rails accomplishes a task poorly, such as performance problems - having a common framework provides a shared, no-need-to-explain context for the problems any Rails app will encounter at certain loads and scales).  The communication advantages a community gets from adopting a common framework are ignored only at one's peril, because those are the guys PHP do-it-from-scratchers (which comprise the bulk of PHP programmers) will be competing with.  If and when PHP develops a common framework everybody agrees to work with (which I don't see happening) they'll immediately run into the same pros and cons as Rails (which I know you agree with, which is why you think the comparison is bunk, but I'm simply saying that there's more to it than you give appear to give credit for).  This:<blockquote>If you think that enough development firms are going to pick up one language so that when acquiring projects from another development firm that it will be easier because it’s written in your language, you’re living in a dream world.</blockquote>is flat out wrong - it IS easier, and I know because I've picked up the projects before.I'll concede that PHP has a long way to go before its a dinosaur; I simply meant that to ignore the trend that Rails exemplifies is perilous.  You never disagreed with that, though; just clarifying.Honestly, I think if you ever get a chance to work professionally with Rails for a month or two, you'll see what I mean.  Even if you used Ruby for scripting or something, you'll see why Ruby is such a "next level" thing.  It's the expressiveness and language-like feel that makes things much less abstract and more intuitive.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The quote you pulled and your response only really show that you didn't get my point (either through my lack of explaining it, or you not reading it closely enough).  My point was that you're never going to get enough firms to pick up a single language and framework to make the task of taking over existing projects easier.  It's the same for PHP or any other language.  There will never be so many firms programming in PHP that it would be easy to move an app from one to another.  So with Rails, there will never be enough firms doing Rails development for this to really get enough traction to be a worthwhile argument.  You'll always be taking over a Java project or a .NET project or a PHP project.  Sure you can possibly say, "We'll only work with Rails code" but the chances of that ever being a wise business decision are unlikely.As for the last remarks, I think <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/feb/ruby-on-rails-fans" rel="nofollow">the link</a> I gave you for Chris speaks well to that point.<blockquote>"You need to be quite a bit more of an advanced programmer to get into Rails."This type of argument always makes me raise an eyebrow. It can be restated as "Our technology is better, and if you were smart enough, you'd agree." If I have to be smarter to use your technology, then your technology sucks.</blockquote>You may not have been saying I'm not as advanced of a programmer, but you were about as close to it as you can get without saying it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[... I also kind of think whenever I make a well-founded counterpoint to you, you're saying, "Ok, well let's strip that part away."  Comparing Rails to PHP w/ no framework is not a valid comparison.  Saying you want to not compare based on the potential of a language is basically the same thing.  If we're not going to deal with the fact that PHP has the potential to take advantage of frameworks, then we might as well rip activerecords or some other piece of RoR off.  Sure Rails CAN do activerecords, but we're not talking about potential, right?]]></wp:comment_content>

I do think a downfall, from what I have read here, IS the framework.  Using a framework to setup everything, but not understanding WHAT it did, is like using frontpage to make a website, and not understanding HTML.  I use Crimson Editor at work.  It does its job, it does it well.....but its all text.  The end code turns out to be exactly what I put in.  Having a framework that does all that for you CAN lead to programmers not knowing what is going on.  If PHP breeds sloppy coders, then I would think RoR breeds High Level coders.  I personally like to know what is going on before I proceed.  Just my two cents, I'm sure I'll get a taste of RoR before the language debate is over.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://allthingsd.com/" target="_blank">All Things Digital</a> has a video of the interview from D5 with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs on stage together.  I had a link for it in my link blog, but I just finished up watching the full version of it and thought it was worth mentioning here.  Both of these guys completely fascinate me whenever I hear them speak (especially Bill Gates for weird reasons).  I don't always agree with everything they say, and I think both can be a little "silly" (in the bad way) at times, but you can't disregard the fact that they've both largely shaped the technology world (if not <strong>the</strong> world) and will most likely continue to do so for awhile still.  It's worthwhile hearing what they have to say.

Here is the <a href="http://d5.allthingsd.com/20070531/video-steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-highlight-reel/" target="_blank">Highlight Reel</a>, check the links below the video if you're interested in watching the full interview (which you'll need to do if you want to hear more then just the funny bits).]]></content:encoded>

He makes some good points, but there is some stuff that I'd like to respond to and clarify...
<blockquote>To say that one language is better than the other is meaningless. Better in what way? The question should always be asked in a particular context.</blockquote>
I definitely agree, in general, I'm just tired of language vs. language debates ... more on that in a moment.
<blockquote>I don’t want to talk about the ads, though, because they have their own agenda and it certainly doesn’t match mine.</blockquote>
Works for me, but keep in mind that most of my original post was working towards making the point that the video's were doing an apples to oranges comparison of PHP (minus framework) to Ruby on Rails.  Jeremy and I disagreed on the validity of this comparison.
<blockquote>For me, that’s why I am using open-source tools in the first place.

...

For me, the bulk of my language preference comes from language philosophy.

...

but for my tastes, I appreciate the additional power that Ruby metaprogramming allows.</blockquote>
These are some key points that I can agree with, but again, more on that in a moment...
<blockquote><span class="caps">PHP</span> =~ <span class="caps">COBOL</span> is not an analogy I would make, but at the same time I’d urge you to consider your claim “You’ll always be taking over a Java project or a .NET project or a <span class="caps">PHP</span> project” in light of <span class="caps">COBOL</span>, or <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span>, or <span class="caps">VAX</span> or any other platform that’s been a dominant success in the past. Current popularity is no guarantee of future popularity. In our industry, better mousetraps are ruthlessly adopted.</blockquote>
I totally agree, as I even said, I can see PHP going by the wayside one day, but today is not that day, and I still believe it's extremely premature to be concerning myself with but so much.  It seemed Jeremy was arguing that Ruby on Rails projects are more easily taken over,  so my counterpoint was simply that RoR, like any other language, is not likely to be so widely adopted that his point would ever really become something you could rely on.  Just to be sure I'm clear, I'm saying that it is unlikely that RoR will become so widespread that you can count on commonly taking over other RoR projects.  This is not me slamming RoR, the same statement could be made in the direction of PHP, .NET, etc.  You'll always be taking over projects built on other platforms.  Even as a PHP developer I experience this commonly.  Just the other day I had to take over a .NET project and we chose to redo it in PHP for various reasons.  I hope that's clear, and if it's not I wish someone would ask the questions I need to answer to make it clear.
<blockquote>If your focus, like in your last paragraph, is only on user experience (by which I think you mean developer experience), then language preference may truly not matter. But if your focus as a developer is on avoiding future “forced” language changes, then it might make more sense to attempt to determine which new technologies might eventually usurp the old. My claim is that Ruby and Rails are better positioned to do so that <span class="caps">PHP</span> and its framework set.</blockquote>
Ok, finally to the point I kept putting off above.  I actually was not speaking of developer experience.  I was speaking of end-user experience, the folks that visit our websites.  THEIR experience is what matters in the end.  PHP, RoR, .NET, etc are all capable of providing similar, if not identical user experiences.  So if I prefer to provide that user experience with PHP, using mainly procedural based programming, then why not?  If you want to do so with RoR, or any other platform, then more power to you.  As you indicated, there are things about RoR that make you prefer it over PHP.  I see no problem with that.  But to say those ways are better then mine, if achieving a particular user experience is the ultimate measure, is sort of pointless, unless you disagree that the languages are capable of producing similar/identical experiences.

I also want to comment on the fact that it seems in these conversations I keep getting pegged as being resistant to change, not eager to learn new languages, etc.  To be blunt, it's pissing me off.  I've lost count of the languages that at some point I've been well-versed in, let alone the languages I've "dabbled" in.  Just because I'm not actively learning RoR at the moment, does not mean that I think PHP is Gods gift to programming nor does it mean that I am resistant to new languages as a whole.  PHP has its flaws.  One day it will be replaced (just like .NET, RoR, and even Java) but I don't think that day is tomorrow or the day after, so I don't feel pressure to move on yet.  I think RoR is doing some great things for the development community as a whole.  Some things I see in RoR, I adopt in PHP.  That kind of thing is good for all of us.  But <strong>again</strong>, just because I don't choose to use RoR, doesn't mean that if something else came along I wouldn't take the time to consider how it might could benefit me.  At some point I'm sure I'll re-assess RoR, and who knows, maybe I'll dive in.  Right now, it just doesn't make sense for me to.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for taking the time to respond to Jim's post.  I feel like he was much more precise in his argument than I in mine.  We're starting to narrow down the scope of our disagreement, I think, which is helpful.

The only thing I really think we're not seeing eye-to-eye on is this developer experience vs. end user experience thing.  Because Rails is so well suited to Agile / XP development methodlogies, it's important to stress that Rails gives developers tools to better satisfy the ***client*** - who may or may not be the end user.  The framework does a lot of the heavy lifting in ensuring that functionality can be rolled out quickly, and the language gives programmers the expressiveness to represent ideas succinctly and legibly.

Now, if you're a startup trying to launch a web app product and gain customers / users, then yes - end user experience matters most, and however you get to end user satisfaction is legitimate (though we can talk about time to market issues).  However, if your success is not going to be determined by end users, but rather by a third party paying for the work, then the ability to deliver value quickly and flexibly matters.  Rails reduces the effort involved in iteratively rolling out features that elicit feedback from stakeholders.

Now, there's no doubt that frameworks exist in which one can do very similar stuff in PHP.  But the fact remains that PHP is not usually the tool chosen to engage in this type of development methodology. Why is that?  It may not be something innate in the language, but it appears to be something innate in the way programmers approach the language.

You may be an exception to this rule, but that's no basis for not generalizing about how a language is used in the real world.  Since languages and frameworks are developed for more than one programmer, it's important to look not only at what these tools are capable of, but how they're usually used.  And PHP is usually used to do quick, dirty applications.  Rails, on the other hand, is used to create much better structured applications - not because the programmers are better, but because the tools are better suited to the typical job.

We talk about better or worse individual programmers, but languages and frameworks are developed with real life programmers in mind.  They should be judged by how they're usually used, not what they're capable of.  That Ruby and Rails are realizing some awesome features and building a community that understands them speaks to the viability of the tool.  It's at least worth investigating.

Of course, you personally are welcome to use whatever tool you want.  And part of the problem we're having here, I think, is that you are taking it VERY personally, with us saying that because we think a tool is generally better suited to its intended application than your tool of choice, that that reflects on you somehow.

No.  It reflects on the general state of the developer community and which tools, over the aggregate, best suit programmers in general to web application development projects in general.  Of course, the particulars of the situation apply, and comparisons can be made on the basis of a certain application or project, but that's beyond the scope of the conversation were currently having.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Honestly, I think a lot of our problem here is that you're assuming I am taking it personally.  The only time I really take it personally is when there is some sort of assertion or implication that I'm being close-minded, which is a personal attack, so responding personally doesn't seem unjust.  I remember at some point you mentioned that you would bring up "I found out how to do x in RoR" and I might mention later "I found out how to do x in PHP."  I'm not saying it because of some "oh my god I need to show PHP can keep pace with RoR!@#" thought in my head.  I'm trying to connect with you on the methodology so we can talk about that, instead of worrying about which language we're both programming in independent of each other.
I mean, if you, or Jim, or anyone, were to say RoR is better then PHP.  I would step in to defend PHP.  But not for personal reasons, but because I think you'd be wrong.  I don't think either language is really better then the other, so neither should be placed above the other.
The fact remains, I believe the end-user experience is what really matters.  Clients desires, when the client isn't the end-user/visitor, are another facet of an already complex discussion.  One that I feel we don't really need to enter into in order to finish, or have, the discussion we're having.
And just because it continues to glare at me even after I've basically finished this comment ...
<blockquote>"PHP is usually used to do quick, dirty applications."
</blockquote>
Sorry ... I didn't realize that flickr, facebook, digg, wikipedia, etc were quick and dirty applications.]]></wp:comment_content>

I didn't mean to imply that there aren't some very good PHP apps out there... obviously WordPress gets a very high approval rating from me, and my favorite Web 2.0 site, Etsy, is a great PHP example.

I just meant to say that a lot of the bad apps out there are in PHP, to say nothing of the custom sites.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Direct link to file" href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/iphone_home1.gif"><img src="http://mattwalters.net/content/uploads/2007/06/iphone_home-150x150.gif" border="0" alt="iPhone" width="77" height="128" align="left" /></a>So I purchased an iPhone yesterday.  All things considered, I ended up pretty lucky in getting it.  I was going by the AT&amp;T store anyhow to meet someone that wanted to buy <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/02/28/samsung-blackjack/">my Blackjack</a> (which I decomissioned a little over a month ago).  Anyhow, the line had started forming, and the store was closed until 6pm when the iPhone's went on sale.  I got there around 5:45 or so.  So I decided to go ahead and wait in line since I needed to get in the store to get to the guy wanting to buy my Blackjack.  I only had to wait in line for about 30 minutes total.  When I got in, I took a quick look and decided to go ahead and purchase the <a href="http://netpurl.com/url/d" target="_blank">8GB model</a>.

I've been playing with it ever since and for the most part, I am very pleased with it.  I don't quite buy into the whole "this is going to change the way everyone thinks about mobile phones."  Sorry, but it's a VERY nice phone/ipod/browser in my opinion. I don't think that we're going to suddenly see a flurry of providers sending people home to activate their phones or anything like that.  I was lucky in that my phone activated instantly, unlike some other reports I've read of people waiting for a few hours for activation (my guess is AT&amp;T/Apple got swamped with activation requests).

Some of the features I'll comment on:
<ul>
	<li>Keyboard: It's definitely nice, and a LOT better then I expected.  I am able to comfortably use it for typing URL's, SMS, and brief emails.  So I am impressed ... but ... it is not going to replace physical "thumb" QWERTY keyboards.  If you are proficient (and by proficient I mean you type with both thumbs and can look away from the keyboard without making massive mistakes) with a thumb keyboard, you will be slower at data entry on this.  What they say about "trusting" it is true.  You need to just type away and let it figure it out, it is extremely smart.  But typing with one finger is just slower then going with both thumbs, no doubt about it.</li>
	<li>Browser: This is definitely something that sets it aside from any other mobile device.  Having a real browser on the phone is so nice.  You can comfortably read websites like CNN, blogs, etc.  I actually hope that bloggers/sites do NOT try to release special iPhone themes for their sites.  It would be an injustice to the browser on the iPhone.  I was out with friends last night and folks started having various side conversations and I started playing around with it and before I knew it, I had cleared out my unread items in Google Reader.  It was completely comfortable to do.  My eyes didn't feel strained and navigation was nearly flawless.</li>
	<li>Phone: It's a pretty good phone.  The sound quality is decent, getting the keypad up and working with it is easy enough.  iTunes sync's all of your contacts over from your Address Book on your Mac, so I was able to easily have all of my contacts available.</li>
	<li>SMS: It uses the "conversation" style txt messaging, sort of like BlackBerry's.  So you can easily carry on txt conversations with multiple people and not get totally lost in the conversations (I txt a lot, so this is great to find out).</li>
	<li>Google Maps: As many people have already said, this is quite possibly better then Google Maps itself.  It is actually one of the applications I've been using to show off the iPhone to friends and none of them have not said "Wow" and left their jaw open after seeing it.</li>
	<li>WiFi: It reliably picks up my secured home network, so in the apartment I can easily browse, taking advantage of my broadband speeds.  If I'm out and it senses a network, it asks me if I'd like to join it instead of using EDGE.</li>
	<li>EDGE: I really haven't had problems with the speed.  It's not as fast as browsing at home on my computer over broadband, but I would not call it painful by any means.  I wouldn't have expected it to be as fast as my home computer browsing either.</li>
	<li>Voicemail: This is really nice.  When a voicemail is left for you, it evidently gets downloaded to your phone or something along those lines.  You can just click listen and the voicemail instantly starts playing. There's no need to dial in to voicemail.</li>
</ul>
Anyhow, I'll try to do a follow up post after I've had some more time to play with it some more as I did with the Blackjack.  I will mention a nitpick I just found out this morning however ...

I went to get in my car, where I have a setup for an FM transmitter that I use with my regular iPod.  It's not one of the iTrip things that relies on sitting flush against the top of the iPod.  My transmitter basically plugs in like a set of headphones would.  I'm not sure if part of the plug is too fat to let the pin go far enough in or what, but regardless, I couldn't get it to play music with my FM transmitter, instead it defaulted to playing with the iPhone's built-in speaker, which is obviously unacceptable for listening to music in your car.  So it looks like I will be looking for some other means of playing music in my car if I don't want to carry my regular iPod.

Anyhow, that's all for now.  And yes, <a href="http://doiexist.com" target="_blank">Pat</a>, I know I'm a lamer.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a continuation of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/06/30/iphone/">my review of the iPhone</a> from earlier.
<ul>
	<li>I was able to get an adapter to let my iPhone work with my current FM Transmitter setup in my car.  It cost me $10.  On the way home from the store I plugged it in and started playing music and it's just as nice as using my real iPod to listen to music in my car.  Then I navigated to the phone and made a phone call.  This is very cool, and something I've wanted for awhile.  Throughout the navigation to making the call, my music kept playing, then when I initiated the call, the music paused and I heard ringing through my car speakers.  It basically turned my cars sound system into a speakerphone.  So basically, the iPhone replaces those expensive bluetooth car phone kits that you can get which tie into your cars sound system (at least somewhat).</li>
	<li>On a similar note as the above comment, the integration with the phone and the iPod continues when listening over the headphones.  If a call comes in, the music pauses and there's a microphone on the headphone wire, so you can start talking.  You just give the microphone a little squeeze to answer the call, and another squeeze to end.  If you're just listening to music you also squeeze the mic to pause and restart the music.  So simple, yet so smart.</li>
	<li>It desperately needs iChat or some sort of AIM/GTalk/Etc. chat client.  I know some folks that are complaining about the keyboard might find this idea horrible, but I wouldn't be wanting to use it for long conversations, just enough to let me pop online and have a quick IM conversation with someone.  You might be wondering why I can't just do this with SMS, but believe it or not, I am sometimes in places that have WiFi but no cell signal (with how my apartment is situated in the building, my bedroom is one of these places).</li>
	<li>It would be nice if there was at least some game on the device to kill time with.  I liked BrickBreaker on my BlackBerry for this, and I usually put Tetris or something on most other phones I've owned.  I think something like BrickBreaker would work on the iPhone too, you could just drag your finger back and forth to bounce the ball.  The interface is already there for it.</li>
	<li>The keyboard is nice, but I'm sticking behind what I said in <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/06/30/iphone/">my earlier post</a>.  If you're proficient on a thumb-style keyboard, you're going to be slower on the iPhone keyboard.  I've become pretty fast with it, but in an Apple keyboard demo video, they show a guy do it with two thumbs and he flies through writing an email.  So I opened notepad and for quite awhile just rambled on, typing out my thoughts, using two thumbs.  It was dropping keypresses like crazy.  It wasn't an issue of it being innaccurate or me fat-fingering words, it just wouldn't register some of my keypresses.  So the software never even got the opportunity to try to correct my spelling (which it is actually VERY good at when I just type with my index finger).  When using just my one finger, I've already gotten to where I rarely have to correct it, and I actually have faith in it correcting me.  I might see a type-o I've made, but I'll continue on spelling the word because 99% of the time, it's going to realize what I meant to type and fix it for me.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stories like this are really starting to get on my nerves.  All Things Digital brings us a story about <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20070706/itunes-universal/" target="_blank">Universal Music deciding to not renew its contract with iTunes</a>, and instead continuing with an at-will style of selling.  From the sounds of it, they want to see things like variable pricing of music put in place, etc.

It doesn't annoy me that the story is being told, it annoys me that the story is there to be told.  Music companies in particular, and companies across all industries need to learn not to bite the hand that feeds them. It's not the artists that feed them, it's not iTunes that feed them, it is the consumers buying the music.  Stop pissing on us or sooner or later, we're going to take away that multi-million dollar roof sheltering you from the outdoors and the fine foods that you eat (yeah, I'm being dramatic, I know).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More on Apple &amp; the iPhone</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just wanted to comment on two blog posts/articles I just read.  The first is from All Things Digital and can be found <a href="http://voices.allthingsd.com/20070706/waiting-for-iphone-20/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Basically the article is a somewhat condemning look at the iPhone.  He comments a lot about traveling with the iPhone internationally and also about the keyboard, etc.  Some of the stuff he talks about I don't really know enough about to attempt a rebuttal, but a fair amount of it is either inaccurate or lacking information to the point that it makes me wonder if I can trust what he says on the things I don't know much about.  Two quick examples are him giving the keyboard a hard time in portrait mode.  This is pretty subjective, so I'd urge anyone to try it for themselves.  I also have found that mine is truly getting better as time goes on, so I wonder how much time he really spent with the phone and how actively he used it.  Another part is he leads the reader to believe that when you need the battery replaced, you will have to go without a phone for a few days while Apple replaces it, however, they already have a <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/service/faq/#faq13" target="_blank">policy in place that says they will supply you with a loaner iPhone</a> while your battery gets replaced (the loaner will take your SIM card and will sync up all your information as soon as you sync with iTunes).

Now, if you want to give them a hard time about something, I would jump over to this post from Robert Scoble about <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/06/why-microsoft-outplays-apple-long-term/" target="_blank">Apple's lack of presence at the iPhone developers conference</a>.  I think that Scoble is right on in his assessment.  It's amazing that the developers voluntarily organized and are participating in this conference, with no support or even presence from Apple.  Apple is losing in two very big ways on this one.  The first of which, as Scoble mentions, is that the developers are having to do all of the leg work.  They obviously want to build for the platform and help it succeed, but as in 1989, Apple is doing nothing to assist them.  The second part they're missing out on, which Scoble doesn't touch on, is that by them not participating the developers are going to do whatever they please, and Apple has no opportunity to help guide them in a consistent and unified direction.

The developers are going to find a way to do whatever they want.  Apple is missing out.  By making it this hard, there is going to be growing resentment in the developer community towards Apple, so as I see it one of two things will happen.  Either the developers will strong-arm their way through and make the iPhone do what they want it to, completely bypassing Apple's desires/wishes/vision for the product (thus destroying a lot of what people like about Apple), or a competitor will rise which makes development easy, and the developers will stop focusing on the iPhone and instead move to the product that doesn't require them to fight in order to develop for it.   Admittedly, it will be hard, and most likely take awhile for a competitor to hope to replace the iPhone, but if Apple thinks it's not possible, they just need to look back at 1989.

I guess there is a third option, which is Apple deciding to release development tools for the iPhone and releasing a method to develop for it in other ways then just web and Ajax.  I hope this happens, but as of right now, I see no signs of it going this route.  For the record in case you don't know me, I am a web developer that is familiar and comfortable with Ajax.  To me, a web developer saying they need to do more, is a statement that shouldn't be taken lightly.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://jsnotes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jason</a> decided to <a href="http://jsnotes.blogspot.com/2007/07/tag-im-it.html" target="_blank">tag me</a>

"list eight habits or facts about yourself, then tag eight more people."
<ol>
	<li>I walk to work every day.  I also usually walk somewhere for lunch as well for probably a total of 2 miles spent walking per day just to get to work, get lunch, and go home (I'm proud of it).</li>
	<li>I just got my first apartment/home of my own (no more roomies) this year, I'm 28.</li>
	<li>I love eating croutons.  Forget the salad, just give me the croutons.</li>
	<li>In middle school, during our version of "home room" the teachers let me "tour" around to the other homerooms to perform magic shows.  I had a table/carrying case for all my tricks that my dad built, and I actually was pretty good at it.  I still have some of my tricks and pull them out at random times for friends.  If you don't believe this, ask <a href="http://jeremyweiland.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a>, I did a performance for his home room.</li>
	<li>I was born in Fredericksburg, but was living in King George (30 mins outside of Fredericksburg) before I was even a year old.  I grew up in King George, but briefly went to school in Spotsylvania (where I met Jason).  Like Jason, I always just tell people I'm from Fredericksburg.</li>
	<li>I'm totally addicted to gadgets.  Small list of some of them: MacBook, iPod, iPhone, AppleTV, Nintendo Wii, multiple digital cameras from low to high-end.  I bought many of them when they first came out.</li>
	<li>I don't go out enough on the nights/weekends (let's get a beer sometime Jason!)</li>
	<li>I rarely respond to meme's, but I figured if Jason was doing it, then all the cool kids were doing it, and I didn't want to feel left out.</li>
</ol>
I'm going to fail on tagging 8 people, but I will tag a couple and see if they decide to respond:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://doiexist.com/" target="_blank">Pat</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jeremyweiland.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com/" target="_blank">Jim</a></li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It really sucks to be honest.  I mean, for one, I should have had them out when I was younger.  I'm only 28, but evidently after 24ish you start running a higher risk for complications during the extraction.  Anyhow, moving on a little with the story. The oral surgeon hasn't given a name to my current condition, but where I to self-diagnose (and that's a real slippery slope), I would say I have what is called Paresthesia.  You can <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/wisdom_teeth/t3_wisdom_tooth_removal.htm" target="_blank">find out more about Paresthesia on this page</a>, it's signs &amp; symptoms almost exactly match mine.  Basically, my lower lip, then going from the corners of my lips all the way down to the bottom of my chin are numb.  Then the gums under my front lower teeth are numb.  Numb is not the entirely correct word for the entire region, for some places it's more of a highly changed sensation.  From what I've read, this condition has the potential to be permanent, however after having spoken with my oral surgeon, it sounds like that shouldn't be the case for me hopefully.  But it does sound like I'm most likely going to have to put up with it for weeks at the minimum, and more likely months until sensation comes back to me fully in this area.  The condition comes from a nerve in the lower jaw being damaged.  It's amazingly annoying.

Talking is a strain. I have to work very hard to be sure I'm not mumbling, and this seems to strain other muscles in my face, causing fatigue and soreness in them.  The muscles in the numb region seem to be going haywire, like they don't quite know what to do.  They're not doing contortions on my face or anything, but they're very tight it seems. If I move my jaw in certain ways, I can feel them tugging on other parts of my face/jaw.

As best as we (read: my oral surgeon) can tell,  the nerve was most likely touched when she was administering the local anasthesia.  She said when removing my lower teeth, she didn't see the nerve (which is usually a good sign), so she doesn't believe the actual extraction caused the problem.

Two days  ago I went in for a unscheduled check-up since I was still experiencing numbness.  She did some tests on the area, basically to get a sense of how much of my sensory abilities were inhibited.  I could in general tell the difference between a sharp touch or a dull touch in all areas she tested I believe.  She did another test where she touched two places on the area and asked me to tell her whether she was touching two points or one, and she moved it around.  I believe she was just moving the points closer together, in all except one area I think I got those correct (another good sign).  Then she did a temperature test.  Basically touching something warm or something cold to different areas, and asking which it was.  For the most part I could tell the difference in all except one area.  I could tell she was touching me because of the pressure, but I couldn't tell if it was warm or cold.  She said temperature is usually one of the last things to return. All things considered, I guess this is good news.  She said I had a good  prognosis for regaining all my sensation.

I go in again today for another appointment (my original check-up after the extraction).  Hopefully I'll get a chance to ask her some more questions I have and get answers.  She measured the area that was altered, so we could gauge improvement over time, but I don't expect to see any change in the course of two days.  I'm not sure she'll even bother to measure again today.

Anyhow, maybe I'm just whining, but I've been real surprised how much this has affected me.  You don't realize how much you rely on that region of your face I guess, heh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I'm done moving now pretty much.  I still need to unpack some things, but I'm totally out of the old place and have turned in the keys for it, etc.  It's been both a good and a bad experience.

I had originally hired Starving Students to do the move for me.  I had scheduled the move with them in March.  The local office was supposed to call me about two weeks before the move in order to get the specifics, confirm the date &amp; time, etc.  Well, about 1 week before the move, I still hadn't heard from them so I called the local office.  They said I was in the system but had been canceled for some reason.  "Luckily" they still had room for me on the day I had planned to move, so he went ahead and uncanceled me and proceeded to go over the pricing.  Most of it was what I'd already been told.  It would have a 2 hour minimum, 1 hour on top of that, $75/hr, and then he told me there'd also be a 9.5% charge on top of the total cost for fuel.  The fuel charge really didn't make sense to me.  I just don't understand why a percentage on the total move would be added for fuel.  Makes no sense in my opinion.

Luckily, I had talked to a neighbor a night or so before and he told me about a company he was using, <a href="http://yellowpages.williamsburg.com/Kid+Gloves+Moving+--26+Storage.327671.5260277.home.html" target="_blank">Kid Gloves Moving &amp; Storage</a>.  He said they'd treated him well and worked really fast.  I called them and scheduled my move.  That was one, of few good decisions I made through-out the process I later learned.  They were great.  They had told me to be ready to let them start moving me by 8am.  They arrived at 7:50am, took a quick look around the apartment and started taking action.  It was 3 guys, and none of them stopped moving until everything was packed.  They followed me over to the new place, took a quick look at the inside, and then they started moving me in.  They were finished moving me by 9:45am.  That's just shy of 2 hours for a cross-town move.  No walls were touched, no items were broken, they were extremely professional.

The only hitch in the actual move itself was that the box spring for my bed couldn't fit upstairs.  So for the past week I've been trying different remedies.  For the first couple of nights I just put the mattress on the floor.  Then I had some slats cut for the bed, but they were constantly falling out (which can be quite loud on a hardwood floor).  Then finally I found a bed store close by that was able to sell me a split-queen box spring.  So tonight, basically a week after moving, I will finally be sleeping in a real bed.  I'm pretty excited about that.

Until Friday (2 days ago), I was unable to get WiFi up in my new home.  I've determined that Comcast is perfect example of how evil corporations can become in this country.  When the technician came out to my house to do the "install" he was rushing everything.  He also had obviously not been told anything about why he was at my home.  I had all of my equipment, it was just a transfer of service.  I even had everything hooked up, all he should have really needed to do is "flip the switch" that gave my home service, and then verify that everything worked.  Well, in his impatience, he decided to swap my cable modem, because the one I already had was taking too long to sync up (he gave it all of about 1 minute max).  Well, he swapped it out, we finally got it to sync, and plugged it into my Macbook, and with a little playing around, it was able to surf the web.  Shortly after he left.  I figured it would be no problem to then get it working with my wireless router.  After all, I'm a pretty resourceful guy when it comes to "computer stuff" and all that.  Well, my router couldn't pull an IP off the cable modem.  So for the past week I have had to take my laptop over to my cable modem and plug it in directly whenever I wanted on the internet for something (pretty much all the time).  I tried all sorts of things, powering everything down, bringing it up one device at a time, making sure things were powered off for the "10 count", all the typical trouble shooting stuff including making sure my router was cloning my Macbook's MAC address.

Well, Friday night, I'd had enough.  Thursday before I went to bed I had unplugged and powered off every device.  When I came home Friday, I slowly turned on each device, giving each device some time to "boot" before bringing the next item on.  It still wouldn't pull an IP.  So I called customer service.  Ugh, I'm still so flustered from the experience that I don't think I can explain it all here.  Basically, I ended up having to call in 6 times before I finally was able to talk to a supervisor.  No one was able to help me.  While on the phone all night with them, it magically started working somehow.  I have no idea what finally allowed it to happen

Basically, I've asked them to credit my account for 1 months worth of service (roughly $200) and I intend to seek out services to replace all things I'm currently paying Comcast for.  I've had nothing but poor experiences with them for the past year, and I pay them way too much money each month to put up with it.  I imagine I'll just be outright canceling my home phone service, and I'm going to see if I can get DSL to replace the cable modem.  As for television, FiOS isn't offered in my area yet, so I may try to check out some of the Dish Network-ish type providers and see if I can replace them there as well.  I just see no need to be paying so much money per month for what can't even be called sub-standard customer support.  It disgusts me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, you may remember my comments <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/06/02/dsl-installation-scheduled/" target="_self">regarding</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/06/01/im-done-with-this-moving-thing/" target="_self">Comcast</a>, and my ... dis-taste for their customer service.  A day or so ago, I received <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/06/02/dsl-installation-scheduled/#comment-99881" target="_self">this comment</a> from a representative of Comcast.  I was fairly impressed that my little blog drew their attention.

I decided to go ahead and respond to the email address that was provided in that comment, and within 15 minutes or so I had received a reply asking for more information about what could keep me as a customer.  I replied back, sharing my stories of things gone wrong throughout the life of my account with them.  That was yesterday.  Last night when I got home, I realized I had some voicemails on my home phone but didn't get to check them.  Today, I received a phone call from a customer service supervisor with Comcast.  She said that she was contacting me regarding my corporate complaint and wanted to see if I had received her voicemails from the previous day, along with asking whether there was anything further she could do to resolve the issue.  It turns out the voicemails from the previous night were hers.  She had left me her office number, along with the office and cell phone number of a Network Engineer supervisor with Comcast.  She apologized for the experiences I'd had, and asked if there was anything further she could do in terms of help or compensation.  I told her I'd been told I would be receiving a one month credit to my service, so I was content in that regard.  Despite my distaste with the company, I'm not trying to "pull one over" on anyone.  I believe in being honest in regards to these things, so to me that means in terms of further compensation, it would be unfair.  Maybe I'm too nice, but I need to stick to my ideals.

It was definitely interesting.  On one side, it's great that I somehow got the attention of such high level support (although I haven't used it, but based on their eagerness to get the information to me, I'd say it's likely not a joke).  On the other side, it's too bad that a residential user of their service had to be bumped up to what seems to be a corporate/executive level of support.

So as the title states, I'm left wondering, is this too late, or have they changed my mind...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you may have seen ... I've been in an ongoing battle of sorts with Comcast lately.  Today I received a bill in the mail for ~$460.  I called to ask a question about my bill and navigated through the automated system, choosing options to get to billing.  I got someone on the phone and stated simply, "I would like to ask some questions regarding my most recent bill."  He got my phone number and then said he'd have to transfer me to someone that could help me with that.  Then a lady answered the phone, I again stated that I had a question regarding my bill.  She said she would have to transfer me to someone that could help me with that after getting my phone number and confirming my identity.  I asked her what department was she with because I'd already been transferred.  She said something like she's just first tier support or something like that, I had to ask her to speak up previously and she barely started speaking more loudly, so I was having trouble hearing her.  She then placed me on hold and transferred me ... to an automated system asking me to put in my phone number.  So I hung up and dialed the number of the supervisor I had <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/06/10/too-late-or-still-in-time/" target="_self">from earlier</a>.  I got her voicemail and left a message asking her to call me back.  Then I called back in to 1-800-COMCAST.  I again navigated the automated system, choosing the options for billing, etc.  Another woman answered the phone and confirmed my identity, then said she'd have to transfer me to someone that could help me with that.  I told her that I needed to be transferred to an actual person and that I kept getting transferred.  I finally gave up on having faith in the ability to transfer me successfully and asked for her supervisor.  She said she would transfer me to a supervisor in billing.  I told her that wouldn't work and I needed to speak with her supervisor.  He got on the phone and finally got me someone that could speak with me about my bill.

It turns out my account has not been credited as I had been promised nearly a week ago.  She was able to tell me that there were notes on my account from the supervisor that had called me back on Tuesday and left me her desk number.  The note said she hadn't noticed the credit I told her I was supposed to be receiving and that she was investigating it further and planned to call me regarding it.  So I'm left waiting for her to call me back.  It is good that she's attempting to be proactive about it, but it's too little too late I'm afraid.  I told the person I was speaking with that I wanted to go ahead and cancel my phone and cable internet service.  You'll never guess what she said ... that's right, I had to be transferred to someone that could help me with that.  Heh, I should have known that one was coming.

Anyhow, I got the two services cancelled, and I'm considering canceling the entire account.  I can use my AppleTV to get HD movies, and I can use Netflix/iTunes to get TV series when they hit DVD.  It's beyond poor customer service now, and is well in the land of absurd.

Comcast ... /sigh

On the upside, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/06/02/dsl-installation-scheduled/" target="_self">DSL has been installed</a>.  Amazingly it has, so far at least, been nothing but a pleasant experience.  I called in to order it, no problems there (although that's nothing special, they're always GREAT at customer service when trying to sell you something).  The guy came out to install it in my house.  He was pleasant, and actually fun to talk to.  We had minor difficulties getting the activation program to run on my MacBook, but then we ran it on my PC and things went through quickly.  My router was acting up, likely because we'd been flipping it between computers and shutting it on and off so much, so I let him go before I had it working with my router.  Shortly after he left I got the router working and called into technical support to get some help with making it work with my DSL modem.  They had no problem with the fact I wanted to get it working with a router.  The phone support simply asked me for the model on my cable modem and the model on my router, and quickly guided me through the steps on both devices (yeah, he even knew every place I needed to click in <strong>my</strong> routers config) and things were working great.  I get the full bandwidth on it (luckily I'm near a central office apparently, which I didn't know until the installation guy told me) and things have been smooth so far.

So, I'd have to say, two thumbs up for Verizon and their DSL service.  I'm even considering getting phone service from them now.  However, two thumbs down on Comcast.  They're having trouble even keeping my cable TV account at the moment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Phone service changes</title>
		<link>http://mwalters8.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/phone-service-changes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" src="http://mattwalters.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/netgear_sph200d.png" alt="" width="194" height="278" />So I've decided to give Skype a good try-out after canceling my Comcast landline and so far I'm pretty happy with things.  I've tried the service before, and it was satisfactory, but the costs on it are getting hard to turn away from now.

I'm not entirely sure why I've become so infatuated with saving money in every way possible, but I have, and one of the ways to do that is to go towards pay-as-you-go type services where it makes sense.  Skype appears that it will cost me roughly $6/mo + $.02/minute.  That's really not too bad.  If I get to where I'm spending over $2.95/mo in phone calls, I can sign up for a subscription for unlimited domestic calling.  That means $9/mo for unlimited calling which isn't too shabby.

After reading some reviews and whatnot I settled on the phone pictured, it's the <a href="http://www.netgear.com/Products/CommunicationsVoIP/Skype/SPH200D.aspx" target="_blank">Netgear SPH200D</a>.  I was able to pick it up on-sale at Best Buy. It's not a full-on WiFi VOIP phone, as it uses a base station (excluding it from being mobile), but it does perform well from my very limited testing so far.  I'll have to update if I think about it later after having had more of a chance to use the phone.  So far I called my cell phone so that I could hear for myself the sound quality and I called my mom (she always gets to be the guinea pig for my new devices).  The voicemail was clear.  I called the phones directly and took turns holding one to my ear while speaking into the other.  I could hear no abnormal hesitation between my speaking into one and being heard in the other.  My testing partner (aka: Mom) said I sounded clear and she wasn't hearing any hesitation between us conversing.

Of course there are downsides to using Skype, but I find them acceptable.  For instance, I can't dial 911 from it, or if the power goes out I can't use it, or obviously if my internet service goes down, I can't use it either.  Actually, if I had a landline, the particular phone I chose can connect to that as well, and whenever you place a call, you can choose whether you want it to go out over your landline or over SkypeOut.  I also have a cell phone to cover 911.  Not perfect as, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't display an address with Enhanced 911, but considering all the years I've gone with pretty much only a cell phone as my phone, I think that's ok.

You might be asking why I'm even trying to have a landline if I've made the jump to solely using a cell phone for so long.  Well, in my previous residence, I had a lot of trouble getting a signal on my cell phone, largely because of where my apartment was in the building.  I was hoping that issue would be resolved once I moved, but that's unfortunately not the case.  I'm typically riding one signal bar on my iPhone with AT&amp;T at home.  It's become quite frustrating really.  But I'm finding ways to work around it.  My family all calls me on my <a href="http://grandcentral.com/" target="_blank">GrandCentral</a> number now, and my friends are finally starting to switch over (you change your phonebook yet Jeremy? Hmm!?  That's right, I'm calling you out).  This allows me to pick up on whatever phone happens to work best at the moment, whether that's my office line, cell, or now my Skype line.

Anyhow, if you don't have my GrandCentral number (the one that rings all my phones), get in touch with me so I can give it to you.  The iPhone may be going away one day, meaning that number won't be available anymore.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I haven't actually received another paper bill yet to have it confirmed, but I spoke with the supervisor at Comcast again and she said it had been applied to my account.  So, that's good to hear, and I'm pretty sure I can trust that it's been applied based on our conversation.  I feel sort of bad because she has been working hard to resolve my complaints and following up on my credit on her own.  If only all of their customer service rep's could care as much as she does, I might not have canceled my cable modem and phone service with them.  Anyhow, I figured fair is fair, and that I should make it known that things appear to have been resolved at this point.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those of you that didn't know, I recently took the motorcycle safety class that let's you get the "M" endorsement on your license in Virginia.  You can just take the DMV test, but taking the class is definitely a good idea.

Anyhow, I took the class this past weekend and passed, so I now have my motorcycle license.  For quite awhile, I had my heart set on a cruiser style bike.  In fact, I was very much looking at the Harley Davidson Nightster, pictured below:
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/nightster.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-392 aligncenter" src="http://mattwalters.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/nightster-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If not that specific one, I was considering something very close (I'd also been looking at the Suzuki Boulevard S50/S83, which are both cruiser style bikes as well).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A week or two ago I was talking to a friend of mine that's ridden for quite awhile, and he said to me, "You know, you should really consider something like a sport tour bike."  Then he gave a few reasons.  At first, I was thinking, "I'm not some foggie" (foggie a word?).  After all, I wanted my bad-ass looking cruiser.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Well, now that I'm ready to buy, and having ridden a mini-cruiser in class, I'm starting to rethink my earlier decision, and what my friend was saying has been weighing heavier in my mind.  A couple of his reasons were that the sport/tour bikes would have the acceleration and cornering similar to a sport bike, but you'd still get the more upright riding posture of riding something like a cruiser.  So it was a good mix of sporty, while still being pretty functional.  He also mentioned that since it would sit higher off the ground, if you took it riding in the mountains for instance on twisting roads, you wouldn't be "scraping pegs" all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Those are all some pretty good ideas if you ask me.  Also after some of what I learned in class, and experienced on the driving range, I'm starting to think that something along the lines of a standard / sport/tour is a better idea for me.  I know I don't want a "crotch rocket."  The strongly leaned over style just isn't for me.  I need to be able to ride the bike for at least a day trip.  Anyhow, so now this is what I'm giving strong consideration to:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/2008_bandit_1250s_abs1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-393 aligncenter" src="http://mattwalters.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/2008_bandit_1250s_abs-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It's the <a href="http://www.suzukicycles.com/Products/GSF1250SAK8" target="_blank">Suzuki 2008 Bandit 1250S ABS</a>.  There's one other similar model that I'm considering, but right now I'm leaning more towards this one.  I actually do like the look of this bike (as opposed to the mental image I'd conjured up in my mind while talking to my friend), and I could see it being a good fit for both local and even day trips.  Besides, if anyone gave me a hard time about it, I could gun it and shut them up in a hurry ;)  (just kidding)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It has anti-locking brakes, 6 speed transmission (good for the highway if needed), and all sorts of other features (low emissions, adjustable suspension for pre-loading, etc).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So yeah ... blah ... guess I'm becoming a "fogie" now, because I'm seriously considering this as the bike I plan to buy now.  I just need to find one somewhere so I can sit on it and see how it feels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Interview (Part 1)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So for those that don't *really* know me, I tend to be a bit of an introvert (ok, ok, for those that *really* know me, a lot of an introvert), and can have some pretty geeky tendencies at times.  But I think the subject matter of this post could be useful to both introverts and extroverts, geeks and non-geeks.  I plan to break this entry up into two posts:
<ol>
	<li>The Professional Interview</li>
	<li>The Social Interview</li>
</ol>
Now, for the geeks amongst you, drop the "Web 2.0" definitions of "Social."  That's not what this is about.  This is more of an experiment in sociology then anything else.  Anyhow, let's go ahead and get into the meat of what I'm writing about.

It all centers around this basic question:<!--more-->
<blockquote>Tell me about an experience you've had that excited you.  What were some of the obstacles you encountered during that experience, and how did you overcome them?</blockquote>
<strong>The Professional Interview --</strong>

Before taking my new position, I was the Web Development Manager for an advertising agency.  One of my responsibilities was interviewing potential developers to get a feel for their skills, and how well they would fit in with the current team.

I think a lot of geeks totally miss that second part.  To them (and me until I had a realization of my own), my social skills shouldn't really matter.  After all, what should really matter is how well I can do the tasks I'll be assigned, and as a coder (from a geeks perspective), my social skills shouldn't really be a variable in the equation.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), that's not the case.  You need to be able to get along with your potential teammates and not cause turmoil in the process.  Your manager doesn't want to have to deal with that, and doesn't want to risk upsetting the team balance.

Now, back to The question.  Many times other managers or co-workers asked me what types of questions I asked.  I also worked with recruiters, and they'd often ask what type of questions I'd be giving their applicants.  Both groups of people often laughed at my answer.

Here's the deal, I've interviewed a decent number of people, and I only ever had The question prepared.  I'd phrase it like this:
<blockquote>Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.  What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while building the project, and how did you overcome them?</blockquote>
The great thing about this question is that it starts a true conversation.  Based on how the applicant answered, I almost immediately knew whether I was interested in hiring them or not.  Let's look at why the question is successful.  The question has 3 basic parts.

<strong>1) Tell me about a project you worked on that really excited you.</strong>

What I really want is to see the candidate get excited.  This part of the question gives them every reason and every chance to do so.  I wanted to see that "burning desire" for what they do for a living to come out and show itself.

<strong>2) What were some of the obstacles or difficulties you had while building the project?</strong>

This is potentially a nicer way to ask, "what are some of your weaknesses."  However it is a little open ended in that regard.  The difficulties they encountered might not be due to a weakness at all, but just a problem that was genuinely difficult to solve.  Either way, the answer they give you is worthy of hearing.  It also potentially gives you the opportunity to discuss some of your personal experience, and how your team operates.

<strong>3) How did you overcome them?</strong>

This is the real meat and potatoes of most interviews anyhow.  Remember in math class how your teacher would some times give you partial credit if you showed your work but made a mistake somewhere along the way?  I think this question is somewhat like that.  I wanted to see how you thought through problems, how your brain works.  Whether I would have solved it the same way does not matter at all.

<hr />

I think the managers, coworkers, recruiters chuckled at me because all they really heard me say was, "I only come prepared with one question to an interview."  I would say back to them, "but look at the question I ask."  Usually once they'd thought it over, it made a lot more sense to them.  Some were always skeptical though.

Let me tell you though, I had some real varied responses to the question in interviews.  Everything from "well, I guess my personal site because it has some flash and that was tough" to 30-45 minute responses that resembled dissertations almost.  The latter was closer to what I was looking for.  The former shows absolutely no burning desire for the work, and little regard for my time to be quite honest.  But again, I'd argue that's one of the best things about The question.  If they give me the short quip, I know almost instantly that they're not a person I'm interested in hiring.  The ones that engage me in conversation, I'll know enough about to make an informed decision on whether they have the technical aptitude to fulfill the positions requirements and whether they'll fit in socially with the team.  That's the whole point of an interview, isn't it?

Even when I'm interviewing for positions, I try to give myself the opportunity to answer this question.  It's pretty easy to work in.  Just wait for the interviewer to ask you a fairly open-ended question (which they pretty much always do), and then answer them by answering this question.  It has a couple benefits for you as well.  You get to show them excitement, you get to show off something cool you did instead of just listing technical skills (boring!).  It also gives you a chance to engage them in a conversation, instead of worrying about what question is coming next.  It takes away some of that innate nervousness that comes with being interviewed.  That's a major plus if you're an introvert like me.

Stay tuned for Part 2 of this post that will show how I've started using this question in social situations to help overcome some of my introverted nature.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Its funny how your perspective on things change as you grow older and wiser.  I remember many moons ago when you worked at Infinity Computers, I wanted you to get me a job there because I really loved computers.  Your response was classic.  It was something along the lines of

"Even if you knew as much about computers as me, which I seriously doubt, we just don't have the work available"

OUCH.....the ego began deflating.  I have always kept that memory, that goal per se.  So if one day, I happened to pass you on the street, I can say hey Matt...check me out now.

Since my senior year, I have tried harder and harder to learn more and do more, and honestly you had a LOT to do with that.  I needed to prove to myself, more than anyone else, that I was capable of proving you wrong.

Now that I am older, and wiser, but still driven, I see that you really had a major impact on my life.  I have had several interviews for several different firms, and you are right that the longer the better.  I interviewed once in PAX river to head up a helpdesk and the interview lasted 3 hours.  We talked about everything.  I interviewed locally hear for another web dev position, and we talked about everything from the job, to the languages, to a 3d game I made for college.  Open ended conversation definitely lead to better interviews.

i guess, in a way, I owe a lot of what I have become to the challenge you set up for me, so thank you.  I am certain you never knew you had any impact on me, but you did.  If you ever want to fill a spot at your company, remember this.....I just might have learned enough to impress even you :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, I'm definitely surprised to hear that I had that big of an impact on you ;)  Especially considering how little I knew back then (about life in general) compared to now.

I have no doubt that you have experience now, it's evident in the comments you've been making here that you know what you're talking about.  Hell, you may even know more then I do when it comes to development.

I've almost always been self taught in what I'm doing for my career, aside from when I was working as an EMT and you had to take classes to get the certifications.  When it comes to web development, I'm most definitely self-taught.  Most of the time it makes me proud of myself, but at times it definitely has its pros and cons.

On the upside, it's made me highly motivated to continue to expand my knowledge in certain realms (PHP, etc).  On the downside, who knows what I don't know.

Luckily, I've been doing PHP long enough these days, that there's basically no task that I don't think I could figure out on my own.

Anyhow, getting back on topic, you should definitely be proud of yourself.  From what I've seen on facebook and comments here on my blog, it sounds like you've made a pretty good life for yourself, which is what really matters.]]></wp:comment_content>

Life is good. Exhausting sometimes, but good overall. Our final deployment for work is in April, so life should get better in may.]]></wp:comment_content>

So I recently purchased one of the new MacBooks released just last week.  I've now had about 5 days to play with it, so thought I'd give my initial thoughts.

First, the hardware.  Here is what I have:
<ul>
	<li>2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo</li>
	<li>4 GB 1066 Mhz DDR3 SDRAM</li>
	<li>250 GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 RPM</li>
</ul>
It feels a lot beefier then my previous MacBook (first gen, black model upgraded to 2GB RAM).  I've been using my previous MacBook for both work and personal usage for the past several months (primarily personal usage before that).  Lately I was feeling it strain at times.  I'm a web developer, so that in general means my normal suite of development tools running (Apache, MySQL, Navicat, TextMate) and also having to run Windows XP in Parallels and, at least at times, Photoshop.  Then of course there's the other average stuff like IM, Email, etc that the average person runs.  All of that together is a workout for most computers, so I didn't really fault my MacBook for straining under the load at times.

The new MacBook however, seems to carry the load with ease.  Today for example I had probably about 10-12 app's running, plus Parallels/XP with 1GB of RAM dedicated to itself, and Photoshop, even with all of that running, it was still extremely responsive.  Definite thumbs up.

Some of the other items I'll comment on because they seem to be getting coverage:
<ul>
	<li><strong>High Gloss Screen</strong>: This really doesn't bother me.  I don't really understand why some people have such negative reactions to it, but they're entitled to their opinions.  I will say that I tend to work in low-light environments, and working from home a lot, I have a great deal of control over my work environment (thanks Business Bullpen!).  So I never notice a reflection.</li>
	<li><strong>Aluminum Body</strong>: It does feel sturdy.  I wouldn't say it feels significanly more sturdy then my old MacBook, but it is very handsome and doesn't pick up the oil smears like the previous black model can tend to do.</li>
	<li><strong>No-Button Trackpad</strong>: It works.  Nicely.  This was by far the feature I was most apprehensive about when I purchased.  My initial reaction when I read about it was, "Oh man!  They ruined a great laptop."  I currently use it with the functionality to mimic two buttons.  I notice that I have to be careful to click distinctly to the left or right to make sure it does the correct click.  It seems to have a little bit of gray-area where it decides which to give you on its own, but now that my fingers are getting trained, I've noticed it becoming a non-issue.  I'm very happy that they still gave it the feel of a button clicking, which is part of what I initially thought they'd taken away.</li>
</ul>
Now, let's cover some of the software I first installed, just for the geeks of you that might be interested, in absolutely no particular order:
<ul>
	<li>MAMP - Great "get up and running fast" dev environment.  I highly recommend it unless you have a real need for a pretty strong custom configuration in your dev environment.  If you're building things that will end up in shared hosting environments though, MAMP likely has you covered.</li>
	<li>Navicat - My GUI of choice for interfacing with a MySQL server.  I've tried CocoaMySQL, and I know it's free (Navicat is not), but Navicat just gets it done better for me.</li>
	<li>TextMate - This is definitely my editor of choice for web development now.  In previous positions I've used BBEdit, and even DreamWeaver, but TextMate seems like the right balance between features, speed, and ease of use.</li>
	<li>NeoOffice - Google Docs doesn't quite take care of all my office needs, at least not well enough.  NeoOffice is an off-shoot of OpenOffice, but made specifically for the Mac.</li>
	<li>iTerm - Improved and tabbed Terminal, 'nuff said.</li>
	<li>Transmit - Great FTP client for the Mac.</li>
	<li>Parallels - Sadly I can't give up on Windows all together, I still need to test my code in IE 6/7.</li>
	<li>FireFox - Duh ...</li>
	<li>Fluid - Easily create app's out of your web-apps (single-site browser).  Whenever I tell people about this app, they almost always get envious when I start mentioning the websites we all use that I've virtually made into desktop app's.</li>
	<li>Adium - Best multi-service chat application there is.</li>
	<li>Dropbox - 2GB for free?  How can you pass it up.  It's installed on all my computers.</li>
	<li>JungleDisk - Mount a Amazon S3 bucket as a drive on your computer.  This is another one installed on all of my machines.  I use it for both off-site personal storage as well as off-site backups.</li>
</ul>
I would say that covers most of the essentials.  I'm sure there are other applications that I'm using, but the list is probably already stretching to the realm of non-noteworthy.

One other thing I will mention is that this is the first time I've started messing with Time Machine.  It really is quite nice.  I use an external USB hard drive to let it keep my backups.  Basically it keeps hourly backups of my files for 24 hours, daily backups for a month, and weekly backups until it runs out of space on your backup drive.  That's pretty good peace of mind, and nice if you happened to delete a file and realize tomorrow that you want it back or need to roll back some changes.  As I mentioned, I'm pursuing other backup means as well (such as S3), so I don't feel it's the only answer, but it is a good answer.

		<title>Front End Web Development Best Practices</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been doing lots of research lately on efficiencies you can put in place on your website to make it more efficient from a load time perspective, which gives a better experience for your visitors.  The problem is none of the sources I've been reading from seem to want to put it all together in one place.  I'm hoping to do that here.  We'll work from the ground up.  Here are some things that every user should be able to do, even in a shared hosting environment where you don't have direct control over the server configuration.

One thing I will not be doing is giving Web Dev 101 instructions.  Even though any user should be able to do this, for some of the items, you should have a basic understanding of things such as what an .htaccess file is and basically how it works.  None of this is too terribly advanced however, so don't worry too much if you're still learning these things.

<strong>.htaccess</strong>
There are several items you can typically control with your .htaccess file to provide for a slip streamed experience when visiting your website:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Expires Headers</span>:
In general, it's fine to let the visitor cache your site.  By properly setting your content expiration, you can prevent the visitor from having to re-download content that their browser has already received:
<pre>&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;
  ExpiresActive on
  ExpiresDefault "access plus 10 years"
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gzip JavaScript and CSS</span>:
With sites offering richer experiences these days, the number and size of the JavaScript and CSS files are starting to get unwieldy.  Luckily it's rather easy to compress these types of components, allowing them to be downloaded more quickly:
<pre>&lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c&gt;
  &lt;FilesMatch "\.(js|css)$"&gt;
    SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
  &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Configure ETags</span>:
<a title="Yahoo! explanation of ETags" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#etags" target="_blank">Yahoo! probably does a better job explaining the ETag situation</a> then I can.  But the basics of it are that, especially in a scenario where multiple servers serve your content, the ETag check (which helps the browser figure out if an item is cached or not) can end up needlessly costing more time when requesting data.  It's fairly easy to turn off:
<pre>FileETag none</pre>
<strong>CSS</strong>
Minify CSS and use a &lt;link&gt; to include it at the TOP of the page: Minifying your CSS will reduce the overall file size allowing it to be more quickly downloaded.  Basically the idea is to remove spaces/tabs/linebreaks.  Browsers don't need those things in order to interpret the files.  So for instance, instead of having:
<pre>#my_wrapper {
    border: 1px solid #000;
    padding: 0px 10px;
    color: #FF0000;
}</pre>
You would instead have:
<pre>#my_wrapper {border: 1px solid #000; padding: 0px 10px; color #FF0000;}</pre>
Many stylings have shorthand versions you can make use of.  For instance instead of:
<pre>#my_padding {padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 10px;}</pre>
This can be simplified to:
<pre>#my_padding {padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;}</pre>
Actually, with the shorthand, you can take it one step further:
<pre>#my_padding {padding: 5px 10px;}</pre>
For the <em>padding</em> style, it basically works like this:
<pre>padding: 5px; /* Apply 5px to all 4 sides */
padding: 5px 10px; /* Apply 5px to top and bottom, 10px to right and left */
padding: 5px 10px 15px; /* Apply 5px to top, 10px to right and left, 15px to bottom */
padding: 5px 10px 15px 20px; /* 5px to top, 10px to right, 15px to bottom, 20px to left */</pre>
<strong>JavaScript</strong>
Minify JavaScript and include it at the BOTTOM of the page. JavaScript can notoriously slow down the loading of a page.  Basically, if the browser complies with the standards, it can only request two items to parallel download from a site.  By including it at the bottom of the page, the browser won't start trying to fetch it until towards the end, allowing your page to be largely (if not completely) rendered.  Minifying the JavaScript is largely the same idea as it is with CSS.  There are also some tools to help <a href="http://javascriptcompressor.com/">minify your JavaScript online</a>.

<strong>Images</strong>
Typically you'll be presented with the option of saving images either as GIF or JPG.  If you're using a tool like Photoshop (which you probably should be), you can usually preview the image as both JPG or GIF.  I'd highly recommend viewing it as both and look in the lower left of the Save for Web screen.  It will tell you the size of the image you are previewing.  You want to achieve a good balance between the quality of the image and the size of the file.  It's not too hard to do.

One thing worth mentioning is that if you have multiple background images, you might want to try putting them all in one file (assuming you don't need it to endlessly repeat along the x or y axis).  By doing this (and then hiding the portions of the image you don't need in a particular area on the page) you lower the number of HTTP requests that the visitors browser needs to issue to get all your background images.  This can decrease the page load time.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">GIF Format</span>:
GIF is a non-lossy storage format for images.  Unfortunately it is limited to 256 colors, however can be a great format if the image you are wanting to serve to your visitors meets some basic criteria.  Since it is non-lossy, the image will be viewed exactly as it was originally saved.  It also supports transparency and animations.  I'm not big on the animations part, but as a web developer, transparency in images is basically a necessity with some of the layouts we have to pull off at times.  If you're using Photoshop as mentioned above, you can experiment with adding or removing colors that will be available in the saved image, but I find Photoshop typically does a pretty good job on its own of determining the best palette to serve with the image.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">JPG Format</span>:
When you have more then 256 colors and need to really compress them down, you might have to go JPG.  JPG supports millions of colors, making it good for photographs as an example.  JPG's should give you an option for Quality when saving them (usually in percentage points).  Using Photoshop, you can play with different Quality settings and preview each.  This has a lot to do with what I mentioned before where you're wanting to achieve a balance between quality and size of the saved file.

Anyone have any other tips for efficiencies or see any corrections I need to make in my post?  I would love to grow this post into a great resource for this kind of thing.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is a great way to increase site loading by doing this.
This variant is for those who are using any other languages of WordPress MU except English.
Translation files are very big, because they contain both admin.panel and site frontend translation. When user goes to the site, they download the whole files with that strings which belong  to admin.panel (and they really don’t need them). More database connections and memory use made. There is a way to make site loading faster. It’s to divide what will user and admin download, while accessing the site.
You need to edit your wp-config.php file, where definelanguage function is. Delete that string and place this one:
<code>if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'wp-admin')) define ('WPLANG', 'ru'); else define ('WPLANG', 'ru_lite');</code>
Of course, you need to change ru to your language locale. The new created file (I’ll tell below) should be put to your wp-content/language folder.
How to create lite, faster loading version of your site frontend? You’ll need Poedit program (it’s freely distributed through the internet). Set the category, where your wordpress installation files are located (on your computer - Not the server). Delete wp-admin and wp-include/js categories. Open your WP translation file using Poedit. Then synchronise your Poedit with remained folder. It will delete hundreds of strings that your site-users do not need at all. Put new translated file to your wp-content/language folder. That all! After this site loading will increase. The number of database connections will too.
Enjoy :)
Feel free to attach it to your post as part of it.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A co-worker recently purchased a new MacBook.  I sent him this email just as a quick-start to help him get going.  I thought I'd share it here:

Some hot keys you'll probably want to know: (fyi Cmd/Command = Apple key, you'll barely ever use Alt or Control anymore)

Cmd-Q: Quits current application.  Just so you know, closing all windows for an application does not mean the application has been closed

Cmd-W: Closes a window for current application, or in FireFox, closes current tab

Cmd-T: Opens new tab

Cmd-H: Hides current application (use cmd-tab or click on it in the dock to get it back)

Cmd-Tab: Basically the same as Alt-Tab in windows, switch between apps.  You can press Cmd-Tab and hold it then use your mouse to quickly activate a program.  Or you can keep hitting cmd-tab to flip through them

Cmd-N: Opens new window for active application.  (so like a new window for FireFox)

Cmd-left arrow: Move cursor to beginning of line

Cmd-right arrow: Move cursor to end of line

------

Those are the are the real frequent ones, but there are others.  A couple good gestures:

4 fingers up: Move windows out of the way to expose desktop.  4 fingers down to bring windows back in.

4 fingers down: Hard to explain, but basically let's you see all open windows, you can then click on one to bring it to the front. 4 fingers back up to exit it (or click on the app you want to see come to the front)

4 fingers left or right: Activates Cmd-Tab interface, click on the app you want to use or brush 4 fingers opposite direction to get it out of the way.

2 fingers up/down/left/right: When you're in a window that can scroll, this scrolls in the direction you sweep towards.

------

Some applications:

<a href="http://www.freemacsoft.net/AppCleaner/index.php" target="_blank">AppCleaner</a>:  More or less a free version of AppZapper, I own AppZapper, but this is supposed to be a good freebie.  Basically they help make sure applications don't leave remnants on your hard drive when you uninstall)

<a href="http://fluidapp.com/" target="_blank">Fluid</a>

<a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" target="_blank">Adium</a>: IM/Chat

<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php" target="_blank">NeoOffice</a>: OpenOffice compiled specifically for Mac

<a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_blank">Parallels</a>: Virtual Machine software

<a href="http://skitch.com/" target="_blank">Skitch</a>: Good for quick and simple image markup

<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="_blank">TextWrangler</a>: Decent text editor for HTML/css, although <a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a> is better in my opinion, but you have to pay for TextMate after evaluation)

<a href="http://www.viscosityvpn.com/" target="_blank">Viscosity</a>: OpenVPN client for Mac

<a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> (FTP):  -- although I highly recommend paying for <a title="Transmit" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>

<a href="http://growl.info/" target="_blank">Growl</a>: Provides a notification system for many applications.  Note: it's possible one of the above applications will prompt you to install it at some point and then install it for you, but if they don't, you can grab it here.

Anyone else have any good tips for someone making the shift from Windows to Mac?  It's been awhile for me, so it's hard to remember all the neat things I probably take for granted now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So earlier today I allowed myself to be pulled into a debate over <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.  Generally speaking, I am not a fan of using Twitter as a conversation tool.  I decided (as indicated in my comment on twitter) that the conversation would be better held in blog post format.  A couple of ground rules for this post:
<ol>
	<li>Pretty much everything here is subjective.  I don't really intend to sway anyone's opinion.  If I do sway it, then it's just by chance.</li>
	<li>What I do plan to do is better articulate my points since in a blog post I have the space to do that.  Being limited to 140 characters makes this difficult.</li>
</ol>
Here is the conversation that was had from beginning to end:
<blockquote>jeremy6d: People who knock conversations on twitter forget that there's not a good alternative for public micro-conversations. What say you, @mwalters

mwalters: @jeremy6d Twitter is not the place for this conversation. :P

jasonkenney: @jeremy6d You could always have have the conversation in the comment section of a blog post

jeremy6d: @jasonkenney that requires the centralization of the conversation; we need a neutral, more spontaneous conversational space

jeremy6d: The post/comment model is too brittle. It reflects the way CERTAIN conversations start. Twitter is clueing us into another mode.

egoodnoe: @jeremy6d I agree but Twitter suffers from lack of threading

jasonkenney: @jeremy6d If you can get this to work (I'm having trouble) it could do it - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5d7rjy" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/5d7rjy</a>

mwalters: @jeremy6d I'd still argue blog posts and use of trackback if a conversation needs to be public

jasonkenney: @jeremy6d Another way is interconnected posts on multiple blogs. Spread the conversation!

mwalters: @jeremy6d I'd also argue that not just many, but most of these conversations don't need to be public other then for the authors ego

bigfleet: @mwalters So in your world, if you don't understand or can't trackback, you are a non-person?

mwalters: @bigfleet I don't mean this as offensive as it sounds, but that's a pretty absurd argument. Perhaps write a blog post to better explain?

bigfleet: @mwalters You posited that a trackback is a sufficient mechanism to expand the audience of a blog post. Those unable to do so are neutered.

mwalters: @bigfleet Easy to get a blog these days, and popular ones support trackback automatically. Plus you're not limited 140 characters

jeremy6d: @egoodnoe that's my point; we need a tool that captures the spontaneity without the poster/commenter duality.

mwalters: @jeremy6d @bigfleet @jasonkenney I'm out at this point ... seriously, write a blog post or something, this is obviously too big for twitter

jeremy6d: @mwalters so why aren't people following your simple plan? Answer: you're glossing over an authentic need.

jeremy6d: @mwalters it's not obvious at ALL that this is too big for twitter. But ball's in your court on how you drive this conversation.

jeremy6d: @mwalters it IS easy to get a blog these days. But the power of twitter is that there's no artificial distinction btw a post and a comment.

jeremy6d: I'll say one thing in favor of @mwalters 's argument: if you need to post three tweets to get your point across, just blog it. -1 for me.</blockquote>
The points I would like to address are:
<blockquote><em>"People who knock conversations on twitter forget that there's not a good alternative for public micro-conversations. What say you, @mwalters"</em></blockquote>
As I said in tweets, I believe that blogging is an acceptable platform for having public conversations (micro or not).  There is nothing that says a blog post needs to be multiple pages.  It can be, "I'm bored" or something more in depth.  Admittedly, the former is a bit absurd to make into a blog post, but I'd argue that it would be equally absurd on Twitter.  I have yet to see a reasonable argument as to why blogging doesn't work for micro-blogging/conversations.
<blockquote><em>"jeremy6d: @jasonkenney that requires the centralization of the conversation; we need a neutral, more spontaneous conversational space"</em></blockquote>
Twitter is NOT centralizing it?  Especially when compared to having it via blog posts w/ trackback?  I'd say it's not only centralizing it, but is doing so poorly.
<blockquote><em>"@mwalters You posited that a trackback is a sufficient mechanism to expand the audience of a blog post. Those unable to do so are neutered."</em></blockquote>
Blogging is very easy to get into these days, and most popular blogging platforms do trackback without the author even having to think about it.  As long as they link to the post which they are replying to, the blogging platform will automatically send a trackback.  For instance, WordPress has this functionality and is easily viewed as one of the most popular blogging platforms that currently exists.

For a little further clarification, I'd say that because of this, arguing trackback as some sort of entrance barrier just doesn't float for me.

As well, I was specifically singling out trackbacks because I know that Jeremy has concern over owning his content, comments/posts/etc.  Trackback is an existing tool that fully allows this.
<blockquote><em>"@egoodnoe that's my point; we need a tool that captures the spontaneity without the poster/commenter duality."</em></blockquote>
It doesn't need to be poster/commenter.  Once you use a trackback to reply to someones post, you have essentially removed the "commenter" connotations, while still allowing someone that is trying to follow the thread to do so.
<blockquote><em>"@mwalters it's not obvious at ALL that this is too big for twitter. But ball's in your court on how you drive this conversation."</em></blockquote>
Of course it was.  You basically admit to this later, so I'll just let this one sit unless you'd like to bring it back up.
<blockquote><em>"@mwalters it IS easy to get a blog these days. But the power of twitter is that there's no artificial distinction btw a post and a comment."</em></blockquote>
There's no artificial distinction between a post and a comment with trackbacks either, and trackback makes following a thread FAR easier then the @ reply system in place on twitter.  It's virtually impossible to follow a conversation thread on twitter unless you're extremely bored and feel like extensively using <a title="Twitter Search" href="http://search.twitter.com/" target="_blank">search.twitter.com</a> or you happen to find the tale end of the conversation, allowing you to follow the thread backwards via "in reply to" links.  This doesn't even begin to touch on how horrible that is (trying to follow a conversation in reverse, c'mon).

Anyhow, that is why it is my opinion that Twitter is not a good tool for carrying on a conversation, especially when compared to blog posts.  Although remember that you are not limited to blog posts.  We are oozing methods of communication these days: eMail, IM, SMS, just to name a few.  Perhaps I'm a Twitter "purist", but I really look at Twitter as more of a beacon system.  It asks the question, "What are you doing?" and I feel that is best used when answering that question.]]></content:encoded>

I've never seen a trackback show up on somebody's blog as a new article of itself.  To me, the artificial distinction between blog posts and comments - based simply on who <em>started</em> the conversation - is the most important thing (this is what Threadspinner was all about, and where I'm going with Forkable Type).  Are you telling me that my comment here is just as prominent on your blog as your original post above?  Why shouldn't it be?Well, I know why: because it's <em>your</em> blog, hosted and run by you for your purposes.  That's the point of a netural space where there is no turf.I expanded my reply to you <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1172" rel="nofollow">here</a>.]]></wp:comment_content>

The argument you propose in your comment is a total tangent for what it's worth.  Twitter is no better at this, and I'd say is worse since from your original post there is no way at all to find replies aside from using search.twitter.com, and there is nothing that shows me there was definitely a response.]]></wp:comment_content>

... really? heh.

First, the only person I potentially annoy is you, not the rest of the world, and since in the past you have specifically stated that it annoys you, I no longer do it.  Many folks start conversations similarly with me over IM, and it turns into an actual conversation.  However it just seems to annoy you (which is fine, and why I no longer do it), although I'd say this stems from you not viewing IM as a real communication tool (which is one reason why it baffles me that you think Twitter is).

Second, I wouldn't use twitter to tell YOU I'm bored because Twitter is not for IM in my opinion.

But really, I'm not going to respond much further on this unless you can tie it into the original topic.  That's not to say I want to halt conversation on it, but I feel you're taking the topic off on tangents to avoid actually disputing anything I've said.

That being said, I haven't read your post yet, which I plan to do next.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'll let Matt say whether he agrees that "Twitter is not public IM".  In my opinion, it is and it isn't.  It is IM-like in being short messages.  It is public in being visible to everyone.  It is not IM-like because of the difficulty of seeing specific replies to each message, thus breaking down the communication.  @someone isn't enough if they have said many things.

People do seem to want the public aspect of twitter, and that is its advantage more than anything, in my opinion.  It is also its main disadvantage, however.  On top of the public veneer of a packeted message bus, we have several ways of targetting  the audience (with @),  and group-like structures (with #), and ways of shortening long URLs and splitting longer messages, and various UIs that glue things back together.  What we will end up with, once it is civilized, something very much like blogs with comments again.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeremy <a title="Jeremy's response to my post regarding twitter conversations" href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1172" target="_blank">has responded</a> to my post regarding the use of <a title="Post regarding use of Twitter for conversations" href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/12/08/twitter-as-a-conversation-platform/" target="_self">Twitter for Conversations</a>.  It seems I need to clarify things a bit further, so let's get down to business.

Jeremy seems to go off on what I'd call a tangent (although apparently <a title="comment by Jeremy" href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/12/08/twitter-as-a-conversation-platform/#comment-100131" target="_self">he deems as merely layers</a> in the conversation) with his post.
<blockquote>my concern is that (1) he misunderstands my original point, and (2) he underplays the significance of what’s going on.</blockquote>
Later on, he states what I figure is the best summary of his point:
<blockquote>Twitter is opening our eyes to a new need people have. It’s one thing to say they are using a bad tool to meet the need; it’s another thing entirely to say that people somehow shouldn’t have this need, or that they should meet the need via available tools when they’re clearly <em>not using them</em>.</blockquote>
I have not, on any medium, ever argued that there is a need going unfulfilled by the proper tool, nor have I ever argued that people should not have this need.  That's just insane, and border-line insulting of my intelligence.  Jeremy and I somewhat straightened this out over IM.  His primary concern seemed to be that I never explicitly articulated this point, therefore I was missing it in his opinion.  As I brought to his attention, there are many things that I have never stated, however it does not make them untrue.

Don't worry folks, I hereby proclaim that gravity exists.  You can all rest easy now.

As well, to clear the water on some other points:

<hr />Twitter for short conversations / floating quick ideas doesn't really bother me, so long as they're moved off to another medium once it becomes obvious that there's too much to be said on Twitter.  As an example:

Bubba: Anyone heard of a bug with IE6 doubling margins?

Gump: @Bubba Yeah, it's a known bug, you can get around it by putting display: inline on the element

Then if Bubba needs to know more, hit Gump up over IM/Email.

<hr />What does bother me is, given no previous conversation, "@soandso What would you like for dinner?"

This is when IM, eMail, SMS would be better used, and where the ego-inflation really comes in.  I'm sorry, I don't care who you are, this is too much.

<hr />As Jeremy admitted, he knew he'd provoke a response out of me, and that's all well and good.  We're friends, so we do that to each other.  Obviously he's free to use the service how he sees fit, and if I don't agree with it, I can always unfollow him as I've done with other individuals.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm starting to realize that I'm just "twittered out."  <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/12/08/twitter-as-a-conversation-platform/">Recent</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/12/08/twitter-as-a-conversation-platform-continued/">events</a> seem to have proven this to me.  Looking back at the twitter conversation that started off all of these posts, it just seems like the conversation was akin to us all walking into a room and just talking at each other, not even pausing for each other to respond.  It seems like none of us, including myself, were really listening to each other.  I would say this only strengthens my point that Twitter should not be used for conversations.  Using it for purely IM purposes (such as "@mwalters want to hang out tonight?") is just downright silly in my opinion.   However, I don't really have the energy to back my point up any further then I have in the past.

Because of this, if you'd like to engage me in conversation, I give you these options:
<ul>
	<li>Call me</li>
	<li>eMail me</li>
	<li>Send me a letter via USPS - promise I'll respond in kind</li>
	<li>Send me a txt</li>
	<li>Send me an IM</li>
	<li>Write a blog post and send me a link to it (using one of the above methods)</li>
</ul>
However, please do not:
<ul>
	<li>Send me a tweet</li>
	<li>Send me a brightkite tweet</li>
	<li>Send me a plurk tweet</li>
	<li>Send me some other micro-blogging service tweet</li>
</ul>
If you do, I'm no longer going to respond in any fashion.  And if I'm currently following you and you do it too much with others, I'm probably going to unfollow you.  Sorry, but it really annoys me.  Twitter already has a signal vs noise issue without being used as an IM service for me.  It's time for me to "put my money where my mouth is."]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Barack Obama was elected on a push for “change” and no more “politics as usual” yet he’s stacked his cabinet with old faces and names, the usual politicians, and pulled a lot of people from Chicago which still has a reputation as being less than stellar. So does this mean pumpkin pie will be any less delicious?</blockquote>
Well, I pretty much knew you or Jeremy (or both, it remains to be seen) would take this opportunity to get me to discuss politics, but as I said, no question is out of bounds.

Barack Obama, for better or worse, had/has a monsterous marketing machine (m<sup>3</sup>) operating for his campaign.  It's no secret that Americans were crying out for "change" after the last 8 years we've seen with President Bush.  So the m<sup>3</sup> latched onto this and made it their battle cry.  What remains to be seen is whether they'll live up to it.  Many different "special" interest groups seem concerned over what he will be trying to tackle during his presidency.

Gun owners, for instance, are up in arms over him "understanding" the second ammendment.  He very obviously intended comments such as those to sway gun owners into believing he would not act to take away any of their current rights.  However, his voting record clearly states differently.

Then there are issues such as what you bring up.  I'm not an expert on Illinois poltics, however you don't have to look very far back in history to see that it is ripe with corruption.  If Blagojevich is convicted, I believe he will be the 4th Illinois governor in recent history to be convicted of a white collar crime.  I'm not implying that President Elect Obama had anything to do with the sale of his Senate seat, however, pulling from that pool of individuals might not be the best idea at the moment for his campaign.

I do believe that some of the scare/concern over Obama is unfounded.  When it really comes down to it, he's one part of the system.  He cannot, on his own, enact all the change he has promised.  He won't be able to single handedly turn the economy around, or have our troops home tomorrow.  However I am concerned about the morale of the American people once they realize this.

That all being said, I recommend you check out one of these <a title="pumpkin pie recipes" href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Desserts/Pies/Custard-and-Cream-Pies/Pumpkin-Pies/Main.aspx" target="_blank">pumpkin pie recipes</a> to make sure it is, in fact, delicious.

<blockquote>If you could have any one thing for Christmas, or be in any one new place, or meet any one person….what/where/who and for what reason.</blockquote>
Thanks for the question Bobby, I'll answer all 3 parts.

<strong>Thing for Christmas
</strong>I'm going to take the somewhat selfish approach in answering this question.  No world peace type of an answer here ;)  I would probably most want a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html" target="_blank">Drobo unit</a>.  I really like how the unit doesn't require you use the same sized disks in the RAID and that it can run <a href="http://www.drobo.com/droboapps/index.php">applications built specifically for the Drobo</a>, basically allowing you to turn it into a mini server on your network.  It's not cheap, but it's feature set is also unmatched.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>New Place</strong>
Narrowing this down to one is tough.  There are many places both domestically and internationally that I would like to visit.  However, if I'm forced to narrow it down to one it would be Ireland.  A lot of my family heritage comes from Ireland and I've wanted to visit there for a long time.  On my mom's side, where most of my Irish heritage comes from, we've been in the states for quite some time (apparently I have an ancestor with a statue somewhere for fighting in the revolutionary war).  Because of that, it's not like I'd really be reuniting with long lost family members.  However it would still be interesting to see where we came from.

<strong>Meet Person</strong>
I'm actually having a real hard time answering this.  I wouldn't mind actually meeting <a href="http://doiexist.com/" target="_blank">Pat</a>.  He and I have been friends for years now.  I think I met him around 1995 maybe?  We've never actually met face to face though.  And we've probably only talked verbally (as in phone or VOIP) for a total of 1-1.5 hours.  I consider him a good/close friend though, so it'd be cool to grab a beer or something.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">An executive drove from home at an average speed of 30 mph to an airport where a helicopter was waiting. The executive boarded the helicopter and flew to the corporate offices at an average speed of 60 mph. The entire distance was 150 miles; the entire trip took three hours. What is the distance from the airport to the corporate offices?</p>

I believe the distance from the airport to the corporate offices is 120 miles.  If the entire trip (including driving and flying time) took three hours, that allows him to drive 30 miles for one hour at 30 mph, leaving 120 miles left.  Since the helicopter flew at 60 mph, it could cover the 120 miles remaining in two hours, adding up to the full three hours the trip took.

However, this doesn't account for the time it took him to change from the car to the helicopter, so you'd either need to supply that information, or accept that he really knows how to hustle from his car to the helicopter ... or he can suspend time.  In either case, I'd like to meet that business man.

I'm voting for the latter - my favorite executive can suspend time.
I wonder what the difference would have been if he had taken the private jet I'm sure he has in a hanger somewhere... perhaps our executive is part of the bail-out, in which case he knew if he drove one of his american-made cars he would never make it to the corporate offices in time, so he tried to save face by taking a helicopter instead...
I guess we'll never know.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="/2008/12/13/ask-matt/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0#comment-100154">Jeremy asks</a>:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If you were asked to launch a major political movement, what would the platform look like?</p>

As I said to Jeremy in an IM after reading his comment, "good grief Jeremy."   I'll make an attempt at tackling the question though.

I think the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution needs to be read and remembered by everyone.  Here's what it says:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>

It's important to realize what that means.  I'm no political scholar, but how I interpret it is this:  Any powers not given to the government belong to the people.  So in essence, the people have all the power, and the government only has those powers which the people give it.  This is a very important foundation in my opinion and sadly one that is all too often forgotten by we the people.  That's not necessarily answering Jeremy's question, but it is important to point out for the purpose of conveying my mindset.

I asked Jeremy if this was intended to be as if I was running for office or if I was just planning to lobby for causes.  He responded, "the hypothetical is less important than just what are your priorities."  It still stays a very open ended question, so I'm going to narrow it down a little.  For one, I'm going to take this from a national perspective, and two, I'm going to limit it to three priorities.

Here are three priorities I would want to pursue:
<ul>
	<li>No more bail-outs.  We're completely killing any chance of the "free-market" working with these.  I don't have access to the exact quote, but a BB&amp;T executive spoke out against the financial sector bail out when it was being proposed.  What I remember from the quote, he basically said please don't bail these companies out.  BB&amp;T is secure because it didn't engage in the risky lending practices, and by bailing out those companies that did, you are giving BB&amp;T's competition an unfair advantage in the market.  We need some darwanism.  I understand that this would likely mean rough (potentially very rough) times in the near future, but I soundly believe that it would be better in the long term.  If I could recall the previous bail-outs, I would.</li>
	<li>Investments in alternative energy sources.  Look, if you think we're ok relying so heavily on oil/coal ... please come out from under your rock and join me in the real world.  I don't believe there's a silver bullet for alternative energy, at least not in a country the size of the United States.  We'll need a good mix of multiple sources from solar, to hydro, to geothermal, to wind.  The most efficient method should be used in its respective geographic area of the country.  This should have been done long ago.</li>
	<li>Finally, I would push for a return to states rights.  I'm not looking to start a secession movement, so please don't mistake my comment.  However I am starting to believe that governing micro issues on a national level is both hugely inefficient and not very realistic.  We are a diverse nation and Region X is being forced to succumb to the needs of Region Y even when the needs of Region Y do not concern Region X.  One of the ideals this country was founded on was more or less, "live how you want, just don't piss in someone else's cereal."  We shouldn't be forcing personal beliefs on one another.</li>
</ul>
Anyhow ... I hope that answers your question Jeremy.

		<title>Backup Strategy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past weeks/months I've become more interested in making sure my systems are properly backed up.  Recently <a href="/2008/12/13/home-work-space/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0#comment-100173">I mentioned</a> I wanted to detail my setup in a post.  It's been awhile since I've suffered a significant hardware failure (knock on wood) so part of me thinks I'm "due" for one.  Here is my basic process and my current setup:

Setup:
<ul>
	<li>2008 MacBook (Main System) - 320GB internal drive</li>
	<li>First Gen black MacBook (Media Center / File Server) 80GB internal drive</li>
	<li>3x250GB external HDD</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220246" target="_blank">2GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220247" target="_blank">4GB</a>, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220301" target="_blank">8GB</a> thumb drives (these particular ones are <em>tiny</em>)</li>
	<li>Account with <a href="http://www.bingodisk.com/" target="_blank">BingoDisk</a> (100GB Plan)</li>
	<li>Amazon S3 Account</li>
	<li>MobileMe Account</li>
</ul>
Process:
<ol>
	<li>My main system has a TimeMachine (250GB external USB) drive connected to it almost constantly.  It's certainly connected when I'm working, and is usually only not connected when I retire to the sofa to watch TV or go to a friends house and am just goofing off on it.  I travel with the external drive.</li>
	<li>Periodically (I try to do this at least once per week) I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html" target="_blank">SuperDuper!</a> to clone my main system to a second drive (250GB external USB) which is also carried with me when I travel.</li>
	<li>Less periodically then in Step 2 I do a SuperDuper! clone to the third drive (250GB external USB).  This so that if my typical HDD clone is for some reason bad, I can step further back in time in hopes that it will be ok.  This drive does not travel with me.</li>
	<li>OSX Install Disk has been cloned to a 8GB thumb drive and travels with me.</li>
	<li>I haven't received it yet, but I ordered <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/" target="_blank">Disk Warrior 4</a> which I also plan to clone to a thumb drive, and it will travel with me.</li>
	<li>My main system has a copy of the music from my iTunes library and some random videos.  I typically purchase new content on my main system and download to it.  Weekly I perform an rsync backup of my iTunes library from my main system to my first gen MacBook iTunes library.</li>
	<li>My first gen MacBook weekly (or whenever I add a substantial amount of content to it) performs an rsync of its iTunes library to Bingodisk.  Its iTunes library has my full collection -- music, TV shows, movies, etc.</li>
	<li>S3 is used sparsely.  I know it's supposed to be supremely reliable, but I have lots of issues with it timing out when copying large amounts of data to it.</li>
	<li>MobileMe account is used to store things like online receipts and various documents I like to keep handy.</li>
</ol>
All things considered, I view this as a fairly comprehensive backup strategy, and it is fairly easy to maintain.  For instance, to rsync from my main system to my first gen MacBook, I quickly mount the volume on my main system and then run this shell script:
<pre>rsync -a -u -v -F --exclude="*DS_Store*" /Users/username/music/itunes/"iTunes Music"/ /Volumes/Media/iTunes/</pre>
Then the script is very similar to rsync from my first gen MacBook to Bingodisk.  It also keeps it from transferring annoying DS_Store files on Mac systems.

I'm hoping to get a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html" target="_blank">Drobo system</a> in the near future to connect to my first gen MacBook and use it for most of my file serving needs and further simplify my backup process.

Anyone see something I'm missing or have any further tips to give me a better safety net?]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>chickens? what do you know about chickens?</blockquote>
Clearly Pat's questions are becoming more in depth, surely a good thing.  He even asked a two-part question this time around ;)
<blockquote>chickens?</blockquote>
Yes, chickens.  As I shared with you over IM, I'm trying to change up the three things listed in the request for questions to, if nothing else, hopefully give the reader a chuckle :)
<blockquote>what do you know about chickens?</blockquote>
Well, I would say I know why the chicken crossed the road.  But <a href="http://jsnotes.com/" target="_blank">Jason</a> still <a href="http://jsnotes.com/2008/12/17/you-got-questions-i-got-made-up-answers/#comment-46588" target="_blank">hasn't</a> answered <a href="http://jsnotes.com/2008/12/17/you-got-questions-i-got-made-up-answers/#comment-45264" target="_blank">my question</a> regarding it.  So I guess we're out of luck on that one unless he chimes in on the conversation.

[caption id="attachment_1307" align="alignright" width="127" caption="Courtesy of Eco India"]<a href="http://www.ecoindia.com/animals/birds/grey-junglefowl.html" target="_blank"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1307" src="http://mattwalters.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/junglefowl-127x150.jpg" alt="Courtesy of eco India" width="127" height="150" /></a>[/caption]

As for what I know about chickens, it isn't much.  However, since you asked, I did a little bit of research for you.  It appears that chickens are believed to have descended from the Red and/or Grey Junglefowl in India (pictured to the right).  Given the yellow skin, it is believed they most likely descended from the Gray Junglefowl (as combinations of the two apparently result in sterility commonly).

I can also tell you that chickens have a higher population then any other bird in the world.  As of 2003, their population was higher then 24 billion.

If you wish to continue learning about chickens.  I would suggest reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken" target="_blank">Wikipedia's thrilling article on the chickens</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The year is coming to an end, and friends and family keep sending me letters saying what's been up with them this year.  Just tonight I received an email from a friend and they said they had opted to go electronic this year for their letter.  That sounded like a pretty good idea.  I've never written one of these, but I figure my blog is a good platform for it, however I will ask that you bear with me since it's my first time with one of these :)

The beginning of the year was somewhat turbulent for me.  It was riddled with sickness and general unpleasantness.  It all started with <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2008/01/24/wisdom-teeth-are-out-and-i-kinda-regret-it/">having my wisdom teeth removed</a>.  Unfortunately something went wrong in the procedure, and the result was the front portion of my lower jaw/lip was left numb.  Luckily feeling slowly started returning to it, and now there's only a very small part that isn't 100%.  I'm starting to think that's permanent, but at least it's not annoying.  Within a week after that, I came down with a cold, and then shortly after that, the flu, or something equally bad.  Needless to say, January/February pretty much sucked.

I wish I could say that was the end of the bad news.  Shortly after that, I ended up finding myself on the way to Mississippi because my Grandfather passed away.  Then, my employer at the time, started having lay-off's.  Unfortunately some people I had grown pretty close to found themselves without a job.

Luckily, things started turning around about mid-year.  I moved into a townhouse (more space!).  Most (all?) of my friends seem to be doing great on the job-front (never doubted that they'd turn out any different) and I've managed to stay fairly close with most of them.  Also, in July, I accepted a position with a new company (Business Bullpen), still doing Web Development.  So far it's been pretty fun.  I'm getting to work on some pretty mind-blowing high profile websites, and I got to move towards developing more heavily with WordPress on some other sites.  Graham and Todd are fun to work with, and I'd probably say I feel more "at home" with this job then any other I've ever had.  That's not just because I get to work from home a lot either ;)

Towards the end of this year I've found myself commuting to Charlottesville twice a week, and probably getting too addicted to TV shows -- True Blood, Entourage, Heroes, House, The Office, 30 Rock, Stargate Atlantis (which is letting me down for its series finale), and some others here and there.

So even though 2008 started off more rocky then I would have liked, at least it finally picked up and things look good for 2009 (knock on wood).  I hope to continue with my <a href="http://mattwalters.net/tag/pic-of-the-day/">Picture of the Day Series</a>, try to get better at staying connected with friends, and keep moving forward.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>I see on this site, you’ve removed comments from all pages [with the <a href="http://carringtontheme.com/" target="_blank">Carrington theme</a>]. Was wondering, did you ever figure out how to get comments to show up on pages? Also, since I’m here, any problems installing ShareThis on this theme?</blockquote>
In regards to getting comments to show up on Pages, I did.  You can see it in action on the page I setup for a plugin I developed, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/projects/wordpress-filter/">WordPress Filter</a>.  I spoke with Alex and he said this will be fixed in the next version.  However, in the meantime if you would like to get it working, inside the Carrington theme directory for your site, open "/comments/comments-default.php".  On line 23 you should see this:
<pre>$comments = $wp_query-&gt;comments;</pre>
You'll want to change it to this:
<pre>$comments = get_approved_comments($post-&gt;ID);</pre>
Once you've made that change, the comments should start showing up.

As for installing <a href="http://sharethis.com/" target="_blank">ShareThis</a>.  I had no problems at all installing it.  Basically just upload the plugin, then activate it and you're good to go.

Hope this helps and thanks for the question :)

Well, Brad, what do you mean, African or European swallow?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I was a bit startled to receive an electricity bill that was a little over double what it had been.  Obviously the key factor at play here was the dip in temperatures.  But it still seemed wild that it more then doubled to me.  I decided to do a bit of an experiment to see if I could a) keep it from rising again since it was getting colder, and b) potentially reduce the amount.

<strong>Changes I Made</strong>

First of all, I took note of my thermostat.  I had talked to the power company and they gave me a basic statistic that for every degree over 68 degree's that you set your thermostat during this time of year, your heater has to work 3 percent harder to keep up.  I have nothing other then them telling me this to back it up, but even if the percentage is off, the concept is logical.  I had my thermostat set to roughly 69/70 degree's.  I reduced it to more in the 66/67 degree range (it's not digital, so I can only be so precise).

I took stock of all my "phantom power" devices.  I had heard that CRT TV's for instance can use almost as much power in the OFF position as they do when they are turned on, and that Plasma TV's weren't much better.  I have a 50" plasma TV and a 30'ish inch CRT TV.  At my Plasma TV I also have a sound system, DVD/Bluray Player, AppleTV, Wii, Cable Box/DVR, and a media center MacBook.  At my CRT TV I have a cable box, DVD player and the TV itself.  Then there's my home office / workstation which has my power adapter for my primary MacBook, speakers, 21'ish inch LCD monitor, powered USB hub, printer, etc.

That is a LOT of devices to try to unplug to reduce phantom power drain.  So I went to Target and purchased several inexpensive power strips.  My workstation uses two of them due to the sheer number of devices.  My Plasma TV area uses one, and my CRT TV uses one.  I wanted to have as little impact on my daily life while still reducing my energy consumption.  So since my HD DVR is at the Plasma area, I put everything except the DVR onto the power strip.  This way the DVR can still record programs even though all the other devices are completely turned off when I flip the power strip.

The other change I made, and this is the part that takes a little discipline is I started forcing myself to turn the power strips off when I wasn't going to be actively using one of the areas.  So if I'm not in my living room watching the Plasma, it's power strip is off.  Same with the other two stations.  When I go to bed, I turn on the power strip for the CRT, watch TV and eventually fall asleep, then before I leave my bedroom in the morning, I make sure to flip it off.  It isn't hard, and it's completely become habit now.

<strong>The Results</strong>

Well, I didn't really know what to expect.  Also, since you don't receive a power bill until you're already partially into your next billing cycle, I haven't been able to test this concept for a full month.  However, the temperatures have been dropping in general still.  But so far the end result is my electric bill went down a little over $25.  I think that is worthwhile personally.  I'll definitely be interested in seeing what the next bill tells me.

<strong>Of Note</strong>

I got this concept from a DIY TV Show once that was focused on being Eco Friendly.  There is a product out there called a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/green-switch-for-green-savings" target="_blank">Green Switch</a>.  Basically by changing some of your wiring a little, you can use this one switch to power down various devices across your entire house.  I lease a town house so a modification like this doesn't work in my scenario.  However, I was able to accomplish almost the same thing with my use of inexpensive power strips.  I thought it was worth mentioning here for any homeowners that might be interested in the Green Switch however.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/3167834193/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/3167834193_6d6a05c111_t.jpg" align="right" /></a>Not connected to my power consumption, but worth noting while I'm talking about being Green is another simple change I've made.  I've purchased several inexpensive wash towels (and my mom even crocheted me a few) that I now use almost exclusively in place of paper towels.  I probably have invested less then $10 in my purchase of these and now go through maybe one roll of paper towels every 1.5-2 months.  I just use them and wash them as I do my regular laundry.  If you have enough, you'll always have some clean ones available, and they're cheap as anything, not to mention way more absorbent then any paper towel on the market.]]></content:encoded>

Your Mac/Printer/etc should all handle it just fine.  Obviously just make sure to put your Mac to sleep or power it off before doing so, otherwise it might drain it's battery and shut down improperly when that happens.  But I use the "kill" switch on my printer and speakers all the time.  I usually shut the power switch off on the monitor though before turning off the power strip.

As for your cable box, I purposefully leave mine so they are not running through the power strip.  The cable box in my living room is also a DVR, so I can't have it being powered off when I'm not around if I want it to still record my TV shows.  However the TV/etc doesn't need to have power for this to work.  Upstairs, my cable box is not a DVR, but I still leave it plugged in to power all the time so that it doesn't lose the channel line up.  It takes too long for the line-up to refresh if you let it completely lose its power.

That's a great question though.  I would say the majority of your devices should do just fine without having power running to them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<blockquote>What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything? Oh and do you have any cool WP plugins coming out?</blockquote>
The answer of course, is 42.  ;)

httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8

As for WordPress plugins, hopefully I'll be releasing version 1.4 of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/projects/wordpress-filter/" target="_self">WordPress Filter</a> soon.  I think WordPress Filter is a pretty great plugin, mainly because it let's someone tap into the simpler Plugin functionality, without having to write a full-blown plugin of their own.  Users can even swap filtersets with each other using the import/export functionality that was introduced in v1.3.

Other then that though, I haven't really thought of any new plugin ideas lately.  I have been giving thought to writing a RSS-&gt;Blog Post plugin that will actually WORK then continue to keep it up so there is one out there (most I find either don't work, or aren't maintained, it's frustrating).  Although I'm somewhat hesitant to both write this plugin and release it, since I am fairly certain it would end up being used by spam blogs at some point.

One other plugin I've been thinking about is a robust calendar (event calendar) plugin.  I don't have any direct need for this, but I've heard several users complaining about the ones that exist either don't do enough, or (like RSS-&gt;Post), aren't maintained actively enough to be worth using.  I don't really see my WordPress 'support' going away anytime soon, so making one of these and maintaining it might be a good way to give back to the community some.

If you have any plugin ideas, feel free to throw them in the comments though.  Never know, I might get bored one night and write it.

<blockquote>Do you know if its possible to turn an email box into an RSS feed?</blockquote>
I'm sure it is.  Although how to go about doing it will depend largely on your email provider.  For instance, if you're on GMail, there's an Atom feed available of your mailbox already, although it requires a feed reader capable of authentication for privacy reasons.

For other providers, it might get a little more complex, but it wouldn't be too bad.  I'm not aware of any services that will do this automatically off the top of my head.   But setting it up on your own wouldn't be all that complex if you have some PHP knowledge (which I believe you do).  You could use something like this <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1120.html" target="_blank">PHP POP3 Class</a> to poll your mailbox then you could use something like <a href="http://simplepie.org/" target="_blank">SimplePie</a> to create an RSS feed of the data.  I don't have any experience with the PHP POP3 Class, but I'm sure if it didn't work out there are likely many more, and probably even IMAP implementations as well.  SimplePie, I have used, and find it to be quite nice.

<blockquote>What causes business cycles?</blockquote>
Talk about a complex question uttered in four simple words.  I'm afraid I may have to take a cop-out on this one.  I don't really see any way to pinpoint it to one, or even ten specific causes.  The number of variables would be so enormous that I could probably write about the subject all night and still never do the question justice.  And yes, I know I said the economy was fair game in this round, sorry for not having a better answer for you.

Although, I could turn around and say they're not cycles at all, since a 'cycle' implies regularity between the upturns and downturns in the economy.  However there is no, to the best of my knowledge, schedule to the 'cycles' we see in the market.

Needless to say however, I wish we weren't seeing the current downturn we're all experiencing.

But if you'd like to discuss it further sometime Brady, let's grab a beer :)

<blockquote>What is the best web language today?
What is the worst web language?

Those are some tough questions to answer.  I've somewhat <a href="/2007/05/22/my-language-is-better-then-yours/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0">talked</a> about this <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/06/06/my-language-is-better-then-yours-%E2%80%A6-part-2/">before</a>.  I would probably say that the problem is the question is too broad.  I'd really need to ask back, "better in what way?"

My personal opinion, and I point out that it's merely my opinion because I've been pulled into debates with folks that disagree on this, is that the visitor/end-user's experience is what matters the most (you have to draw your line in the sand somewhere, that's where mine is).  I feel that most of the currently popular web languages are capable of producing the same result to the end user, so the developer should use what they're most comfortable with, whether that be .NET, PHP, Ruby, etc.  You're going to be able to find clients that will let you develop in any of those languages, so that's not a sticking point to me.  It's difficult to go much further beyond that without more definition around the question.  For instance if you wanted to take it down to OOP, one language might start shining compared to another, or if it was an issue of smallest learning curve, another language might take the spotlight.

I know some other folks that argue it's whoever the client is might dictate the language, and I see merit to the argument, however I've also found that you can lead a client towards a particular language under many circumstances, aside from them already having an internal environment setup that they want you to develop for (although I've also had clients willing to setup an environment just for what I'm building them).  So, all that to say, there's a lot of exceptions/gray area.

I personally prefer PHP for web development.  It has a low learning curve, outstanding centralized/maintained documentation (seriously ... it blows the rest out of the water when it comes to documentation in my opinion), and an amazingly strong community behind it.  It's also a strongly proven language for web development.  All one has to do is look at Facebook, Wikipedia, Digg, WordPress, etc, and you can see it hard at work.  Yahoo! also has a strong presence in the PHP community which has led to some great API's for search, geocoding, mapping, etc.  Most of their services have an API, and most of those API's will return results in serialized PHP, making developing on top of them very easy.

As for the second question, which is worst, I'm not sure I can answer that for many of the reasons I outlined above.  There are some horrible ones out there, but they likely started to scratch an itch, you can't necessarily blame the language if it got bent out of it's original purpose.

The third question is an interesting one.  I think I would likely argue that it would show the capabilities of the developer.  Given that I view choosing the correct language as what the developer is most comfortable with, I'm not sure that I could answer any other way.  I've yet to see a webapp/website built on a language such as Ruby on Rails/.NET/etc that I couldn't replicate in PHP.  I might not be able to replicate something made in .NET in Ruby/on Rails, however that is not a fault of Ruby, it's a fault of my knowledge of the language.

Anyhow, sorry it took so long for me to write an answer, it's been a busy week.  Hope that at least somewhat answers how I feel about the questions.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good responses.  I tend to agree with everything you said.  I MISS PHP, current tasking is in ASP.CLASSIC also known as hit your head on the keyboard every other day.....PHP is a great language.   I wouldn't say its a small learning curve (curly brackets and parameter ordering tend to kill newbies) but once you get the C++ style language down, it's so much easier to learn other languages like Java or Perl and such.

I'll stand on my soap box for a second though and say i despise Cold Fusion.  Its not even a language, its a macro.  I have another task that was developed in CF and that gets on my nerves with the utter and complete lack of power you have.  A server side language should have server side power.

As far as strength of the developer vs limitation of task...I think a knowledgable enough developer should be able to pick up a new langauge in a short enough period of time, so the chosen language would probably be more because of the task than the person.

I know that prior to my current job, I had PHP knowledge.  We were tasked with converting our system from ASP/Fox Pro to something more Web 2.0 compliant.  I ported everthing to PHP with MySql and overhauled the site.  Demo'ed it, they liked it....then said we had to host it on Gov't equipment and had to move to Classic ASP / SQL Server.  So, I ported it again.  Prior to the report, never had any ASP experience....but it operates in similiar fashion to PHP, so wasn't to hard to recode.  I don't think our site could be done in CF.]]></wp:comment_content>

So, I guess the question for you is…..what is the best database and why?</blockquote>
Well, given my background, you can probably guess that I'm going to end up recommending something that is open source.  I would also say  most of my experience comes from databases that have a strong presence in the web community.  Historically, the bulk of my experience is with MySQL, which really is a nice database platform.  It supports several table types (MyISAM, InnoDB, etc) which have their pro's and con's.  It also enjoys wide support from programming languages.

I'm not sure that I would rate it as the best though.  For instance, about 3 years ago I released an online feed reader called OneFeed.  It had a nice Ajax front-end that looked like Outlook's typical 3 pane view.  Then it had crawlers on the back-end that were parsing the feeds that users had subscribed to.  It was definitely a learning experience.  My #2 bottleneck ended up being the database.  I had started off on MySQL with MyISAM table types.  Well, the feed crawlers were basically writing to the database non-stop, as in 24/7/365.  They were having to parse over 20,000 feeds once every hour at its peak.  So the problem is that with MyISAM, when a write goes to the database, it locks the entire table instead of just the record that is being written to.  This was bad because it meant the user interface was being slowed down because of the crawlers trying to keep up with their job (there were 12 crawlers at the peak).

So, I ended up shifting over to InnoDB which allows record level locking on tables, and this definitely sped things up quite a bit.  But the database was still sluggish to respond on certain queries.  The database size was also exploding.

About this time is when I shut OneFeed down.  However, I was speaking with another developer that was working on an online feed reader as well.  They, too, were having the same issue that I was and they took it to the next step, which was switching to PostgreSQL.  With PostgreSQL they were able to kill several birds with one stone.  They achieved faster query times and smaller database sizes.

PostgreSQL also offers triggers and more robust features.  However, some of this is becoming moot as the platforms have started moving towards each other.  MySQL has picked up triggers, etc, and PostgreSQL has been stepping it up on performance.  So, these days, there's less difference between the two for the average user.

Anyhow, that's about the most I can tell you.  I'd say MySQL probably has broader market share, but PostgreSQL is somewhat viewed as being more robust still.  I really don't know tons about Oracle, and have only played minimally with MS SQL Server.  So I can't really comment accurately on those.  I know my brother likes SQL Server, and I've never really heard him (or anyone really) complaining about it being stupid.  So if you're living in a Microsoft world, I'm sure it's a great platform.  I've never really had to work with SO much data that I even needed to consider Oracle as an option.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not a dba so I can't weigh in on this with tons of technical details.. but I work for a region CLEC telephone company. We process 10 million call records a day (I'm being conservative there) and these records have a chance to pass through both SQL Server (2k) and Oracle 10g databases. Of those records, at any given time 750k remain in the SQL Server database, and 6 months are stored in Oracle. Whenever I have to go digging through call records, I cringe when I have to deal with SQL Server. Takes forever to find what I'm looking for, in a very small data set. In Oracle, that has at least 400 times as much data.. I get better performance. I know in theory this can be effected by partitions and indexing... similar indexing takes place in both table, and the partitioning that takes place in Oracle still leaves each one far larger than the entire SQL Server database.

Query performance aside.. what about rollbacks? I've had a simple rollback in SQL Server turn into a 3 week nightmare that completely shut down our operations, and in the end it failed anyway. I've never experienced that kind of flakiness in an Oracle rollback.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[i guess in those exceedingly large cases Oracle serves a purpose.  In my case, I want the BASIC operations to always work flawlessly, rather than the ADVANCED operations work sometimes when I need them.

In SQL Server, you right click the server choose backup, and its done.  With Oracle, I have had it crash during that more times than not.  (This is on 3 servers it just didn't work right).  On SQL Server, right click...import.  On Oracle, crash.

I have had complex queries die in Oracle (like queries with multiple subqueries) and the reason.....the error message literally says 'your query was to complex', when the same query works fine in sql server.

In sql server, dates are parsed natively, in oracle....you must use the to_date function, which breaks SQL-99 compliance.

Oracle has issues with null characters in BLOBS, which makes file storage complicated.  Sql Servers Image column type worked fine.

There is actually a bug where Oracle will not run on any server who's hostname starts with either a U or a P.  How in the world can a product with a bug like that even be in production?

The list of inner nuances goes on.  I guess if you need to deal with millions and millions of records at the same time, you should use Oracle and put up with the issues.  Since my largest table is 600K rows, its just not necesarry.  Atleast Sql Server always works with everything i have ever needed.  And the longest running queries I have take a minute in SQL Server, vice 45 seconds in Oracle.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, it's been awhile since I've appeared in a newspaper ;)  Last time, I found myself on the front page of the Richmond Times Dispatch for an article about blogging.  Unfortunately I don't still have a copy of the article on my computer, only a hard copy.  Anyhow, this time is not nearly as splashy, but still cool all the same.  A couple weeks back a reporter for the Wall Street Journal contacted me in reference to this article I wrote about <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2009/01/16/on-being-green/">being green</a>.  Here's the part he quoted me on:
<blockquote>The new TVs are finding favor with some consumers. After getting a $186 electric bill in early December, Matt Walters, a Web developer in Richmond, Va., decided to look for ways to reduce his electricity use. He quickly targeted his 50-inch plasma TV, which has a digital video recorder, Blu-ray player and other devices connected to it.

"I started looking for devices that were more guilty than others," says Mr. Walters, 29. "The plasma TV was one of the first things" he identified.

Mr. Walters bought a few power strips to connect the TV and other devices together and got in the habit of turning it off when he wasn't using it. When his electric bill arrived the next month, he says to his surprise he saved $27. He plans to pay more attention to the power use of the electronics he buys, and adds that he would consider an energy-efficient TV for his next purchase.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Webhosting is something I am frequently asked about.  I've had a site hosted in some fashion since the late 90's, so dealing with the in's and out's of hosting is something I've become quite familiar with.  These days I've even moved towards configuring my own servers to host my sites.  But this article isn't going to get into that side of things.

I decided it was time that I finally chronicle what I've learned over the years and what my current setup is along with the reasons I like it how it is.  To the average user, my setup might seem complex, but even if you only put a couple of these practices to work, I think you'll find yourself well on the way to having a pleasant experience.

I practice a fairly modular setup for my array of websites and it has its benefits.  By splitting things up I can get the most bang for the buck by putting critical systems on providers that provide mission critical support, and other things on more inexpensive solutions (yes, even in hosting you largely get what you pay for).

Moving on to my recommended setup:

<strong>Registering your domain</strong>
This is the first step in setting up a website for yourself.  I highly recommend <a title="eNom" href="http://enom.com/" target="_blank">eNom.com</a> as a registrar.  I've been using them for nearly 5 years now and they're a pretty solid registrar.  Even if you have already registered your domain somewhere else, I'd recommend considering a transfer of your domain to eNom.

The main reason I like eNom as a registrar is the free DNS hosting, which is crucial to my setup.  However, in general they're a good registrar.  Their prices are competitive, managing your domain is easy with their web interface, and they aren't always trying to push additional services on you.  Don't get me wrong, additional services are there but they don't shove them on you.

Allowing them to host my DNS is the linchpin of my setup.  Many webhosts ask you to set the DNS servers for your domain to theirs.  Unfortunately changing nameservers is still a drawn out process, sometimes taking up to 24-48 hours to complete.  Compounding the issue, many times you can't setup the DNS records on your new nameservers until the domain servers have changed.  This can mean even more hours, potentially of downtime, for your site.  Since my DNS is with eNom, if I change webhosts or email providers, I can just update the zonefile for my domain and usually within an hour or two everything has changed over.

If you REALLY like your current registrar, then you can look into other third party DNS hosting services that will still allow you the benefits I'll be describing below.  I just happen to prefer eNom.

<strong>Choosing an email provider</strong>
Many folks will choose to host their email with their current webhost.  That's fine, but I'd argue there are other solutions, better solutions, available to you.  The one I use is GMail.  Google's interface for GMail is pretty top notch and the fact that you can get <a title="Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new" target="_blank">Google Apps</a> for your domain for free, why not choose them?  Their downtime is extremely low, and you can use the web interface when you're not around your computer.  If you do like the feel of a desktop client though, you can still access your email via IMAP or POP3.

Google Apps is also a scalable solution.  You can start off on the free version and add up to 50 users on your domain.  If you outgrow 50 users, or you start running into storage concerns with your archived email you can always convert to the paid version at $50 per year per user.  That's really not that bad of an option unless you have a spare exchange server sitting around (but really, if you have that kind of infrastructure already in place why aren't you just hosting your own website?).

Also, by sourcing your email to a third party like this you also ease transitioning between webhosts should you ever need to.  Since your DNS is hosted by a central party, you never have to change your MX records (the DNS settings that tell your email where to go) when you change your website from one host to another.  This means no concerns over some email getting left on your old host, or losing emails in the transition, etc.

See how hosting your DNS on your own is starting to fit together in the plan?

<strong>Choosing a webhost</strong>
This is probably where 90% of my friends that have problems make their mistake.  Webhosting is a low margin business.  They make their money by hosting as many people on as few servers as possible.  The sheer number of competitors in the industry make it almost problematic.  You have everyone from high school (maybe even middle school these days) kids that buy a reseller account with a webhost and then offer plans at $1.99/mo, promising 99.999% uptime and unlimited disk space/bandwidth.  Then on the other end of the spectrum, there are folks offering webhosting for $50/mo and you don't necessarily get $50 of service per month.

Let me be clear, you do not want to host with someone promising unlimited services and extremely high uptime guarantees.  If they're an industry giant, like Yahoo perhaps, you will probably be fine but there will usually be catches involved in the plan.  There are a couple things you should be aware of though between the those two possible scenarios.

<em>Scenario 1 - The fly by nighter</em>
In this case, you're definitely in trouble.  They'll soon get bored, or start wondering why they aren't making any money and chances are they'll just shut the server down, leaving you without access to your website (possibly email), etc.  It could take you days to recover.  The whole time your website is down.  Don't even get me started on how these folks tend to like advertising 99.999% uptime.  They often have trouble achieving 80% uptime.

<em>Scenario 2 - The industry giant</em>
You're in a slightly better situation here, but keep in mind these companies are in it to make money.  Usually the small print of those agreements you're making during sign up include text saying that if you start to use too much disk space, bandwidth, or processor time, they have the right to shut your site down.  They'll put up all kinds of walls to keep you from actually storing terabytes of data on their servers.  They can't make money on you if they do allow it.  If you plan on using reasonable resources though, you're probably fine, but an industry giant selling unlimited disk space, etc, likely isn't going to do that for $1.99/mo.

So if your website is even the least bit important to you, I recommend you plan on spending around $10-$20 per month on your hosting.  You can find some rock solid providers in that price range and it's really not that expensive.

As for my personal hosting plans, I currently have plans with two separate providers, but that's not something the average user is going to need.

My primary hosting plan is a (dv) server with <a title="Media Temple" href="http://mediatemple.net/" target="_blank">Media Temple</a>.  It hosts mattwalters.net and <a title="SnipIt.me" href="http://snipit.me/" target="_blank">SnipIt.me</a> along with some other small sites I have setup mainly for testing purposes.

My other hosting plan is with <a title="slicehost" href="http://www.slicehost.com/" target="_blank">slicehost</a>.  This plan is where <a title="WordPress Easily" href="http://WordPressEasily.com/" target="_blank">WordPressEasily.com</a> and its hosted blogs reside.  WordPress Easily is quite the complicated setup though.  The nature of the service dictates needing to be able to bring new servers online quickly or swap out servers, etc.

Just to finish tying in the modular concept, by having all 3 of these services sourced to different providers, it leaves me in an agile position.  If I need to move to a different webhost for some reason, I can easily change the DNS records for my domain and have my site moved over quickly.  Or if I need to point a subdomain to a different server for whatever reason, it's a quick change.  Same goes for email, if I wanted to change to a different provider, I could do so without affecting my websites.  Really, the only catch to this setup is I can't easily change registrars ;)

Hope you've found this informative and maybe even taken away something good from it.  If you have any tips you'd like to share, by all means feel free to do so in the comments :)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>WordPress Backups</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Backing up your site is something that is very important to do.  You never know when you might make a change that you need to revert, or you install a plugin that goes haywire harming your site.  A reliable backup routine that is put into practice early and often is always a good idea.  I authored a <a href="http://wordpresseasily.com/2009/03/15/backups/" target="_blank">post on backups over at WordPress Easily</a> that I thought folks might find useful even outside of that services' context, so I've decided to convert it here as a more all-purpose backup strategy.

Many web hosts have backup plans in place.  However they are usually more focused on protecting the server from a catastrophic failure then they are about being able to restore a backup because a piece of software you installed messed up your account.  In general, it's best to never rely on your web host to have you taken care of where backups are concerned.  What if they go out of business?  What if they have a catastrophic failure that's so bad even their backup plan can't recover from it?  What if you just want to change web hosts?

So that leaves the question, what can you do for your WordPress site?  Well, there are many tools out there to help with this.  The first, and easiest, is using <a title="WordPress XML Export" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Manage_Export_SubPanel" target="_blank">WordPress's built in XML export</a> of data.  This will get all of your posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags.  If you ever have to restore your site from it, it's as easy as using the <a title="WordPress XML Import" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Import_SubPanel" target="_blank">built in XML import</a>.  Unfortunately it does potentially leave out some data.

Some plugins store their data in their own database tables, which won't be included in the XML Export.  To get that data backed up, you may want to consider using something like the <a title="WP-DB-Backup" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/" target="_blank">WP-DB-Backup plugin</a>.  It can create a SQL Dump of your entire WordPress database, including table structures and data.  If you ever need to restore from that you'll want to make sure that you have access to a tool like phpMyAdmin with your web host, or the plugin mentioned in the final option below.  You'll need to be able to execute queries directly against your database to restore from it.

A final option, and probably the most advanced, is you can use <a title="WP-phpMyAdmin" href="http://wordpress.designpraxis.at/plugins/wp-phpmyadmin/" target="_blank">WP-phpMyAdmin</a>.  This gives you a copy of phpMyAdmin within your WordPress administration panel.  You can export your database from this (which will create a SQL Dump file just like WP-DB-Backup), then if you ever need to restore, you can use WP-phpMyAdmin to import your database.  I wouldn't recommend WP-phpMyAdmin unless you're fairly comfortable working with SQL Databases.  But if you have a SQL Dump of your WordPress database, chances are whichever host you are using, they'll have a method to let you restore it.

All of that takes care of your database and most of your content, but what about your themes, documents, plugins, etc?  You can use an FTP program to download your site to your local computer.  You probably don't even need to do the entire site.  If you download your /wp-content/ directory that should take care of anything you need since that is where your themes and plugins are stored, as well as any files you upload from within the WordPress administration area.

As I said, it's recommended that you get a backup plan in place early and that you practice it often.  You never know when you'll need that backup.  It could be never, or it could be tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Custom Fields in WordPress</title>
		<link>http://mwalters8.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/custom-fields-in-wordpress/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While working on a site recently, a common problem was run into using WordPress as a full fledged CMS.  The issue was needing to have multiple content areas within the same Page.  For a developer (front end or back end) this typically isn't an issue, even inside of WordPress.  Since the content area allows you to insert custom HTML a developer can just flip to HTML view and position things on the screen how they see fit.  However, that's not always a viable option when handing over content management to your client.  The client may not have the knowledge nor the desire to learn HTML on their own.  This can leave the theme creator in a difficult position.  Luckily WordPress provides Custom Fields as one way to help get around this predicament.

Custom Fields in WordPress can be used for many things:
<ul>
	<li> Assigning images to Posts (featured image or thumbnail)</li>
	<li>Serving as a data source for content to be loaded via Ajax</li>
	<li>Providing multiple content areas for a Page (custom sidebar for instance)</li>
</ul>
One "gotcha" of using Custom Fields to solve this issue is that the size of the input area is limited.  There are possible ways around this limitation, but they're outside the scope of this Post so we'll save that for another time.  Putting that all aside though, they can definitely help get you to where you need to be.

Custom Fields have two components, "Name" and "Value."  If you're of the developer mindset, think of it as a simple key-value pair.  You can have multiple identical keys even on the same Page/Post.  Once you have used a key once it then becomes available from the select box on future Posts/Pages, making it easier to reuse custom fields for similar operations on other pages.  You can use <a title="get_post_meta() on WordPress Codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta" target="_blank"><em>get_post_meta()</em></a> anytime the WordPress core has been loaded for the Page view and you have access to a Post or Page ID.

Let's take the third example, providing multiple content areas for a Page, as an example in using Custom Fields in your theme.  We'll be using <em>get_post_meta()</em>.  Here are some basic steps to move towards putting this all together:
<ul>
	<li>Edit a Page you would like to add a unique sidebar to</li>
	<li>Add a custom field name of "sidebar"</li>
	<li>Add any content you would like to the value field</li>
	<li>Save your Page</li>
	<li>Create a Page template file inside your theme directory</li>
	<li>At the top of the template file add this PHP code:</li>
</ul>

<pre>$sidebar_content = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, 'sidebar', false);</pre>

Some explanation:
<ul>
	<li> $post-&gt;ID feeds the primary key of the Post or Page that is being displayed by your theme</li>
	<li>'sidebar' is the "Name" or key for the custom field you added to your Page in the WordPress Admin</li>
	<li>false tells <em>get_post_meta()</em> to return an array of key-value pairs for the requested key.  If set to true, it would return a single result as a string.</li>
</ul>
From here, adding the extra content to your Page template is fairly simple.  Perhaps you have a sidebar container you would like to place it into.  You could use this PHP code to do that:

<pre>foreach ($sidebar_content as $content) {
  echo '&lt;p&gt;' . $content . '&lt;/p&gt;';
}</pre>

The above example would loop through each Custom Field you had added with the name 'sidebar' and would display its content wrapped in a paragraph tag.

Using this overall approach you can now add custom content areas to specific Pages or expand upon the idea to perform other customizations such as easily formatting a thumbnail for a Post/Page.  By using a custom field for the thumbnail, you can then format the thumbnail differently based on the context it is being displayed in, as opposed to just inserting it into the copy area of the Post/Page.  For instance, if you wanted to wrap the copy around the image when displaying it as a full Post or Page you could do so, but if you wanted to display recent Posts on your homepage with the copy blocked to the right of the image, that now becomes easy as well (it's just a matter of html/css markup at that point).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>BlackBerry Curve 8330</title>
		<link>http://mwalters8.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/blackberry-curve-8330/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2009 01:25:32 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator>mwalters8</dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://mattwalters.net/?p=2904</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2907" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/883_47.jpg" alt="BlackBerry Curve 8330" width="66" height="123" />Roughly 9-10 months ago, I switched from my iPhone to an enV2 with Verizon.  AT&amp;T's coverage was just horrible, basically making my iPhone an iPod Touch with an expensive monthly subscription cost.  Anyhow, the enV2 served me well, but I got to where I was needing to keep a closer eye on some things (WordPress Easily, some work stuff, etc) so moving back to a real "Smart Phone" was making sense.  Enter the BlackBerry Curve.

I have <a href="/2006/04/19/blackberry-8700c/?phpMyAdmin=544c4b4bff4ct2249f7e0">previously used a BlackBerry</a>.  I always remembered the BlackBerry as being a consistent and reliable device, but using the Curve I'm starting to realize just how much I really enjoyed the style of phone.  It really is a well thought out device, from push email to the tactile nature of the keyboard, from how stable the platform and applications are to the new store for BlackBerry apps.  So far I'm really enjoying the device.  I won't go on and on with a long review, but here are the basics as I see it, in no particular order:

Pro's:
<ul>
	<li>Verizon service.  It's extremely rare that I see No Service.  I actually can't remember the last time a call dropped because of my service or that I was unable to place a call.</li>
	<li>Keyboard: I've said for a long time that this is a key advantage of the BlackBerry over the iPhone.  I really like the iPhone as a device, and the keyboard logic on it is superb.  But the easiest way to explain it is on the iPhone I constantly had to watch my typing to see if it was going to catch/fix the typos I would surely make.  On the BlackBerry, I just don't make the typos to begin with.</li>
	<li>Applications:  The BlackBerry has REALLY improved in this realm since the last time I used one of the devices.  Here is some of what I have installed:
<ul>
	<li> GMail (the application version) - This works well for checking my multiple gmail and google apps accounts, though I do wish I could control the update interval, but I really like that it is able to keep conversations grouped, etc.</li>
	<li>Pandora - Wow ... over a cell phone's internet connection I can't believe how well this works.  Quality enough to make an audiophile happy?  Probably not.  Quality enough to make me happy? Yes.</li>
	<li>Google Talk - It's not often that I need to IM over the BlackBerry, but this is a great real time client for when I do need to.</li>
	<li>BlackBird Twitter Client - It isn't going to stun you with its looks, but it has the core functionality I want when I'm using twitter on the go.  I'm usually only checking updates on the go when I'm bored, I can quickly skim with Blackbird.  It also works well for sending updates and catching @replies even from people I'm not following.</li>
	<li>Google Maps - Not sure this needs explanation.  It's a great app and works well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Con's:
<ul>
	<li>Trackpad/Scroll ball: They really should have stayed with the thumb wheel in my opinion.  It is tolerable, but I preferred the thumb wheel.</li>
	<li>Keyboard: Weird this is mentioned in both places right?  It's a little on the small side, but I find it hasn't been a problem and I'm adapting quickly.</li>
	<li>Camera: I was a little torn how to rate this.  Listing it as a Con may not be appropriate ... but it's a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low.</li>
</ul>
Overall, I would say my feelings about the device are positive.  I'm really liking the new applications that are available and I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to the CrackBerry once again ;)  Not to keep comparing it to the iPhone, but that's really the only device worth trying to compare it to ... in my opinion, the BlackBerry is still the Gold Standard to be beat.  The iPhone rocks, but they still need to work some things out if the BlackBerry userbase is a target audience (which it may not be and that's cool, there's enough room for both products).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>WordCamp RVA</title>
		<link>http://mwalters8.wordpress.com/2009/05/09/wordcamp-rva/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_3409" align="alignleft" width="250" caption="Me presenting at WordCamp RVA"]<img class="size-full wp-image-3409" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/xt2.jpg" alt="Me presenting at WordCamp RVA" width="250" height="219" />[/caption]

So WordCamp RVA was today and I was really pleased with how well it turned out.  There were periods today where I was nervous about my presentation, then other periods where I figured it would be fine.  There were times (in the morning) where I was worried if eveything would work out well and whether or not enough people were coming, but in the end I think it turned out great.  Folks seemed to be happy with the content and attendance was just about perfect I think.

It really blew me away that we had folks traveling up from Georgia for the event.  I mean ... wow.  Guys, if you read this blog, let's get a WordCamp Atlanta going on.  I'll help.  There's no reason Georgia shouldn't be able to support it's own WordCamp.

As I said at the event, and have mentioned on twitter, etc, I'm really hoping to organize some follow up events to the main WordCamp Richmond (/RVA) event.  I'd like to focus them on real in depth topics like theme development where we actually take some time and build a theme from scratch.  I'd also like to do the same with plugins.  Plugin development was something I was reluctant to cut from my presentation, but I knew there just wasn't going to be time for it, and it's also a topic that would be really hard to present without giving so many code examples that a lot of the crowd would have been put to sleep.

Anyhow, I would like to give a huge thanks, once again, to <a title="Your Search Advisor - Andrew Miller" href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Miller</a>, <a title="Chris Gatewood" href="http://twitter.com/gatewood5000" target="_blank">Chris Gatewood</a>, and <a title="Business Bullpen" href="http://businessbullpen.com/" target="_blank">Business Bullpen</a> along with all the other that helped make today happen.  I may have been in the middle of it all, but they made it easy on me and I really can't thank them all enough.]]></content:encoded>

Where did you get your start? Did you start with a platform and learn the PHP and CSS as you went? Or did you have a foundation of the code first?

In short, which came first… Wordpress or the code?</blockquote>
Good question, thanks for posting it.  The short answer is the code came first.

I started as a PHP developer before I even knew what WordPress was (in fact, I'm pretty sure it was before WordPress, in its current form, even existed).  My first project in PHP was a blog, it's a great way to teach yourself any web language if you ask me.  From there I built a multi-user / multi-blog system called LSblog (it was basically Blogger, supported templates, comments, image uploads, etc).  From there I started making content management systems and then moved into Web Development professionally.

A little bit after LSBlog, I jumped around between blogging services quite a bit, but ended up settling on WordPress while it was still in its infancy (shortly after it being forked from b2).  I was still early in my PHP development, so I banged my head on the desk a lot as well as I tried to customize it.  It was even harder back in those days.  For some changes, at that time, you had to edit core WordPress files to do things (which is considered a big no-no these days due to the great Theme/Plugin architecture that WordPress offers).

I definitely think that having a foundation in PHP outside of WordPress will only help you in your WordPress development, especially if you ever venture into plugin creation.  It's not 100% necessary probably, but it will help you understand why WordPress does some things how it does and will allow you to choose the right solution for the job.

But don't be afraid to try things, and don't be afraid to write sloppy code (in the beginning).  Every coder has written horrid code that they have nightmares over having to go back and support it.  Sloppy code happens when you're learning and with time you'll start writing code that is more efficient and easier to support / enhance.  You'll also get better at digging through existing code and finding ways to make it do what you want it to do :)

Personally I like flickr.  I'm a Pro (paid) user with the service and have been since before Yahoo purchased them.  It has always seemed to work well.  If you're going to be uploading tons and tons of photo's, I find it's easier to use a service like that which isn't going to limit you on storage space or bandwidth.  Additionally I use the <a title="Flickr Photo Album" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-flickr/" target="_blank">Flickr Photo Album</a> plugin to have a <a title="Matt Walters Photos" href="http://mattwalters.net/photos/" target="_self">photo album on my site</a>.

For the number of photo's I tend to take and upload, having them on my server/account just ends up becoming problematic.  If I ever change web hosts, moving them is difficult if not impossible.  So I guess my answer would depend on how many photo's you plan to host.  If you'll have a low number, I could see a decent argument being made for just hosting them yourself.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Those of you that have been around me, any at all, over the past 6-8 months know that I've been working hard on educating folks in the area about WordPress<sup>1</sup>.  For whatever reason it is something that I really have a passion about and for once in a really long time I've been pursuing that passion.  It all started earlier this year.  I had been reading a lot about WordCamp's and really wished one was happening closer by.  So I sent out <a href="http://twitter.com/mwalters/status/1226604913" target="_blank">this tweet</a>:

[caption id="attachment_3511" align="aligncenter" width="440" caption="You would not believe how hard it was to find this tweet ..."]<a href="http://twitter.com/mwalters/status/1226604913"><img class="size-full wp-image-3511" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/1226604913.gif" alt="You would not believe how hard it was to find this tweet ..." width="440" height="120" /></a>[/caption]

From there, the train started rolling and there was no stopping it.  Folks started replying.  I started getting ideas for topics and before I knew it <a href="http://wordcamprichmond.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Richmond</a> was born.  I have many people to thank for helping me make this happen, Chris Gatewood of <a href="http://hf-law.com/" target="_blank">Hirschler Fleischer</a>, Andrew Miller of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Your Search Advisor</a>, Eddie O'Leary of <a href="http://teamcolab.com/" target="_blank">CoLaB Multimedia</a>, <a title="Business Bullpen" href="http://businessbullpen.com/" target="_blank">Business Bullpen</a>, and all of the speakers that gave up their time to prepare presentations and then gave up an entire Saturday to share their knowledge with all those in attendance.  I am grateful to all of them, and all those who attended.

Over the past months I have been busy helping individuals with their WordPress sites, building some sites for clients of my own and expanding my knowledge around WordPress as a whole.  Many people in the area seek me out when they have a question about WordPress, and that makes me happy.  I'm glad that I'm able to give back some to the community that I have taken so much from.

It has become quite hectic these past couple of months.  I've been rolling multiple freelance projects at a time, small things here and there, but they've been slowly and steadily growing in complexity and size.  I've come to the realization that it's time for me to take the next step in this evolutionary process.  I have decided to start my own business (after much prodding from my friends).  I recently was told by my lawyer (Chris Gatewood of Hirschler Fleischer by the way) that the formation of my LLC has been made official.  We're just waiting for the SCC to send the certificate in the mail.

I am excited beyond belief at the idea of this.  I have met with an accountant and lawyer to make sure my ducks are in a row.  I'm signing up for insurance for the business to make sure I'm all official and protected.  I've gone through almost all of the motions needed at this point.  I'm also excited about continuing to give back to the community.  WordCamp Richmond will continue to be an annual event, I will continue to help folks, develop plugins and hopefully much more.

So what's left you might ask?  Well, I'm still in the process of getting my website built.  I am teaming up with <a title="studioSavvy: Graphic Communications" href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/" target="_blank">studioSavvy</a> to have a design produced for the site.  We've worked together on a couple of projects now and I look forward to many more with them.  They're fantastic if you ever need design work done :)

Other then that though, my plan is to continue working my current full time job and continue to grow the business.  Once I finally reach that tipping point I hope to be able to securely walk away from working for someone else and never look back.  This is something that I know I can make happen, and I can be very "dangerous" once I've made up my mind about something.

I will be releasing more information about my new company in the near future, and hopefully will have the website ready to launch by the end of the year.   But that doesn't mean I'm not open for business right now :)  So if you're in the need of some custom WordPress work (theme development, plugin development, or anything else), please think of me and please refer your friends to me.  I promise not to let you down.

<hr /><sup>1</sup> Oddly enough though ... I rarely find time to blog my thoughts ;)  I hope to change that.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>2009: Year End Review</title>
		<link>http://mwalters8.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year I started a <a title="posts tagged with Year End Review" href="/tag/year-end-review/">series of Year End Review posts</a>.  I figured it would be good to continue it this year as so much has happened in my life in 2009, that it's likely not many people know where or what I'm doing any longer.

Unfortunately the year started off poorly.  Early in the year, as the economy tanked, I came really close to losing my job.  The guys I was working for fought long and hard though and were able to keep pulling in enough business to allow me to stay on which I greatly appreciated.  Around this same time, I thought it might be good to start cultivating other opportunities if I needed them.  I took a look at the things I was doing and what I really enjoyed, and thought about how to start making that be able to support me.

Early in the year, I announced that I would be organizing <a title="WordCamp Richmond" href="http://wordcamprichmond.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Richmond</a>.  It is an all day event where folks get together and discuss all things related to <a title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, the powerful blogging and Content Management System for websites.  It also helped me to get my name out there in the local area to let folks know that I was around and could help them work with this tool.  Anyhow, the event came and went, and was a great success.  We had more attendee's then I thought we would, the speakers all performed amazingly, and we're already planning another again in 2010.

Not too long after WordCamp I purchased a new-to-me car, a 2006 <a title="Pictures of my Subaru Outback" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157619443567630/" target="_blank">Subaru Outback</a>, LL Bean.  It's been doing great and really helped out with all the snow we got a week or two back.  <a title="Atticus" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwalters/sets/72157611702737938/" target="_blank">Atticus</a> enjoys riding around in the back and it's an extremely comfortable car to ride around in.

Let's not forget that I also met and started dating Carrie this year :)  We get along great and have spent a lot of time together the past couple of weeks.  Atticus approves of her, so you know she's good stuff.  She attended WordCamp and at some point after it we started talking, and then talking some more, and eventually I worked up the nerve to ask her out and she said yes.  Things have been great ever since.

Towards the end of Summer, I switched jobs to become a contractor at Capital One.  This was my second time back and I enjoyed it, however my stay was brief.  In November, I began speaking with a friend in Denver, CO about a new opportunity.  The new opportunity involves me managing and staffing a <a title="WordPress HelpCenter" href="http://wphelpcenter.com/" target="_blank">help center for WordPress</a>.  Individuals can call or email us, and receive professional support for their sites/themes/plugins at reasonable prices.  I started work on December 7th and so far things are going great.

So it has been a bumpy year, switching jobs, meeting new folks, starting my business, and many other things.  Even though is seems the year flew by, I'm not sure I can say it was because I was having so much fun.  I'm just hoping that some of what I accomplished this year is going to let me have more fun in the coming years.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A day or two ago I put up a quick website over my lunch break. If you need a quickly generated and secure password, then feel free to make use of it.  I mainly made it because periodically I just need a quick temporary password, perhaps for a temporary FTP account on a clients website, or a database password that I wont be commonly using on my own, etc.  I have an idea or two for some enhancements to it, and will try to work them in when I get a chance. 

Anyhow, here it is, <a href="http://toughpassword.com/">ToughPassword.com</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five of my must-have tools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the recent past I've started gathering some pretty useful tools / programs to simplify my life and help me streamline my work flows.  I wanted to share some of them in case others might find them interesting.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4609" title="textexpander_iphone" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textexpander_iphone1.png" alt="" width="60" height="58" /></a><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> - This is a recent addition to my toolkit and I am finding it nearly endlessly helpful.  From coding snippets to canned email responses, it is speeding up my work.  I work in a helpdesk situation of sorts and this allows me to quickly piece together emails from verbiage that we commonly use.  On the coding side of things it helps me out by allowing me to not remember the .htaccess syntax for increasing PHP's memory limit, or turning on error reporting and display_errors.  Complex code snippets are saved for a program I'll mention in a moment, but I'm finding uses for TextExpander all over the place.  Also helpful is its ability to sync snippets across Dropbox.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4611" title="TextMate_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/textmate_icon1.png" alt="" width="61" height="61" /></a><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - The Missing Editor for Mac OS X.  That's a fairly accurate description in my opinion.  It is a panacea for nearly all your editing needs.  I use it for coding (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, etc) as well as working with SQL files.  It has features such as Subversion integration via Bundles.  Also available -- <a href="http://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle">WordPress Bundle</a>,  Markdown, and much more via bundles.  Having syntax highlighting available for basically any coding language I could open is extremely helpful, and if you can get accustomed to working with plain text files, something like this will work great for you.  Given the amount of WordPress work I do these days, I love having the WordPress bundle available.  Creating things like Widgets are basically a 5 minute operation for a simple widget now.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4612" title="evernote_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/evernote_logo1.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - Great tool for working with notes, remembering things, and having easy access across devices (I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Mac Mini).  This is an easy solution for keeping my notes available to me no matter what device I have handy.  It seems to fit the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS Principle</a>".  Need to make a to-do list?  No problem, create a bulleted list and add a checkbox at the beginning of each line so you can easily track what has been done and what needs doing.  But I can also keep pictures available there if needed, along with notes about them.  It also lets me break my notes up into notebooks so I can more easily separate my work items from my personal items.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4614" title="dropbox_logo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dropbox_logo1.png" alt="" width="59" height="59" /></a><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - This is a fantastic, yet simple little utility I've grown to love over the past couple of months.  More often, I am switching between my laptop and desktop computers.  Since I typically store many things I might need on my dropbox, I can easily keep working on whatever is at hand.  I have also been using it to share items with friends and coworkers.  I get asked why I used Dropbox from time to time by folks in an effort, I believe, for me to convince them why they should use it.  I usually don't bite on this though.  I think some folks have a use for it (such as folks that have several devices/computers and want an easy way to have files available to all of them) and some folks don't.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4615" title="1PasswordLogo" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/1passwordlogo1.jpg" alt="" width="57" height="57" /></a><a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> - If you haven't come across this one yet, you should definitely go check it out and try it.  I have so many passwords these days, it's nearly impossible to keep up with them.  However with 1Password I'm able to use a simple hotkey when sitting at a log in form and it instantly enters the correct username and password for me and submits the form.  It even includes some anti-phishing protection to help prevent you from entering your username and password on a site pretending to be one of your common sites.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are many other tools I enjoy using, but these 5 have quickly integrated themselves into how I work and I think if I lost any of them I would be quickly looking for some form of replacement.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Online Services for Your At Home Business</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following on the heels of my post of <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2010/08/24/five-must-have-tools/">Five of my must-have tools</a>, I thought I'd share this list of services that might be valuable to others that have started their own at-home business.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4677" title="harvest_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harvest_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> is a service for tracking time, expenses, and invoicing your clients.  I find it very easy to use and manage due to its straight-forward interface and tools such as the <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/widget">Dashboard Widget</a> and <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/features/iphone">iPhone application</a>help with keeping track of my time.  The emails sent to clients are customizable and the invoices look professional with the option to include your logo.  It also supports partial payment of invoices as well as invoicing services and products.  If that's not enough, you can also define different hourly rates for different people, or different projects, or even different types of tasks.  Plus, you can give log-in credentials to contractors so that they can track their time in your system, making it easier for you to invoice the clients.  If you like PayPal, it even has invoice payment integration with PayPal and automatically marks invoices paid when payment is received via PayPal.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4679" title="googleapps" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/googleapps1.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="83" /></a><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for Domains Standard</a> is a great, free, solution for your e-mail, calendar and document management.  Web mail allows you to use your email from any computer, and IMAP access allows you synchronized read status across your multiple devices (computer, phone, etc assuming all your devices support IMAP).  The calendar program is feature rich and helps you keep on top of scheduled events.  Google Docs is an easy way to create and read simple documents is basically any format.  Though for more complex things you might still find yourself wanting a more robust editor.  The great thing about the Standard edition is that it is free for up to 50 users so you can stick with it if you decide to grow your company, and with things like Sites (Google Apps version of a Wiki) you'll have a place to share documentation for policies/procedures/etc.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4680" title="icon_ringcentral_bigger" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/icon_ringcentral_bigger1.png" alt="" width="73" height="73" /></a><a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/">RingCentral</a> can work quite nicely for your phone needs.  Whether you want to sign up for it and just send calls to your cell phone, or if you want to buy an IP Phone to have a nice desk phone that calls ring into.  I use an IP Phone with my account and have had no problems at all other than my internet connection going down.  But in a previous job we used it and routed calls to our cell phones which worked well too.  You can define different call rules for different hours of the day so that during nights/weekends calls go straight to voicemail, but during normal hours your calls will be routed to your cell or IP phone.  It costs a little money, but can be nice and is another service that can grow with you if you decide to grow your business including features like auto-attendants, "office" extensions (though you don't all need to be in the same place), etc.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4681" title="rtmdesktop_128x128" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/rtmdesktop_128x1281.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> is a simple task management system with some surprisingly powerful features.  This is a recent re-entry into my work-flow.  I like the ability to create different lists, whether it's a grocery list, or keeping track of follow-up calls/estimates/quotes that I need to send out for work.  They make the data entry as painless as possible and then you can setup things like iCal feeds to have tasks show up on your calendar.  There is also a pretty decent iPhone app available to Pro customers that let you take your to-do list with you to keep up with things.  I also have used this in a previous position and the ability to let team members send you tasks via email that are then added to your to-do list can be nice to have if working with multiple folks.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="campfire_icon" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/campfire_icon1.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" /></a><a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> is an online chat room for teams to collaborate and keep up with each other.  Admittedly, this one is a bit of a stretch for a small at-home business but we all need to collaborate with others on projects from time to time and if you're working from home, this might be the perfect solution.  For free, Campfire offers you a chat room with up to 4 simultaneous chatters and up to 10MB of space for uploaded files.  It can be a quick way to chat with multiple folks about a project and share images.  It could even serve as the virtual water cooler if you're working with other folks in different geographic areas or if you just want to invite some friends into it to fight off the lack of social interaction from working at home :)

<strong>Bonus</strong>

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4683" title="fluid_icon2" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/fluid_icon21.png" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a><a href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a> -- This one is definitely more team focused.  If you have several folks on your team and you're interacting with Twitter then I would consider this to be a must-have for your team.  It allows you to receive email alerts when someone sends a @reply to your twitter account and allows you all to be logged into the same Twitter account at once and see conversations your account has had with users before you respond to them.  If someone else on the team has already responded to someone, you wouldn't want to send a second response from the same account, would you? :)

What would be on your list?  I'm always looking for a better mouse trap.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>2010: Year End Review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another year is coming to an end today and I'm finally getting around to writing this post, the third in my series of <a href="/tag/year-end-review/">year end reviews</a>.

It's been a long and eventful year.  Maybe it would be best to update based on the different parts of my life.
<h3>Work</h3>
I started off the year working as a contractor at <a href="http://wphelpcenter.com/" target="_blank">WordPress HelpCenter</a>.  It was a great experience and even though I have now left WPHC, I still think very highly of the company and Alex King, its founder.  In the beginning of the year, I was the lead for the team.  I grew a lot as a developer, a sales person, and as a customer service rep.  It was a fast paced environment, likely the most fast paced I've ever worked in.  Towards the end of Fall I was presented with a new opportunity to work on-site with a local company, <a href="http://www.snagajob.com/" target="_blank">SnagAJob</a>.

So far SnagAJob has been great.  I'm continuing to grow as a developer and am still able to work with WordPress and PHP (my areas of expertise).  I am really enjoying getting to know the folks I work with and am finally getting around to trying Test Driven Develoment with Unit Tests.
<h3>Personal</h3>
You may remember me having <a href="/2009/12/27/2009-year-end-review/">mentioned Carrie last year</a>.  We moved in together around May and have been traveling a good bit this year.  We've been to Phoenix AZ, Boulder CO, Baltimore MD, Las Vegas NV, and New York NY.  That's probably more traveling then I've done in the past five years combined and also represents the furthest West I've ever traveled.  We had a lot of good times and eventually I'm going to get around to posting some of the pictures we've taken on this website.  Around our one year anniversary, I decided to ask her to marry me and, amazingly, she said yes.

We're working on plans for the wedding and have booked a venue and set a date, October 8th 2011.  We've started a <a href="http://mattpluscarrie.com/" target="_blank">website</a> to let folks know what we're up to with plans and "us" in general.
<h3>Hobby</h3>
I haven't been as active with my photography as I have been in the past.  This might seem odd given all the travel we've done this year, but I've been trying to focus a little more on living/enjoying the experience rather then trying to document it with my camera and missing what it is I'm photographing.

I've been continuing to work with WordPress a lot both in my work and free time.  I assisted in organizing WordCamp 2010 again this year.  This time around I was mainly acting as a "care-taker" of the event.  All thanks and recognition should go to Carrie &amp; Hunter at <a href="http://studiosavvydesign.com/" target="_blank">studioSavvy</a>, and Andrew of <a href="http://www.yoursearchadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Your Search Advisor</a>.  They took care of working out the schedule, locating sponsors, etc.  I'd say it was even more successful then last year and that's entirely thanks to the three of them.

&nbsp;

I think that pretty much covers some of the larger highlights of the year and let's you know where I am.  Let's hope all goes well in 2011 :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I turn another year older.  With this comes all the happy birthday emails, wall-posts, etc.  After receiving birthday wishes from some folks I haven't talked to for a while asking me what I'm up to these days, it got me thinking...  My life has been a bit of a journey, and I'm only 32, I can hardly imagine what I'll think of it when I'm 60 ... 70, etc.

For a long time I fought with myself over what I could achieve given some of the decisions I made in my early adulthood.  I never did graduate college.  Instead, I chose to go straight to working from high school.  Even for my generation, this was considered a mistake by most.  I would definitely agree that it was not the easiest path I could have chosen.  However, I've been lucky enough to make some good friends and have some interesting experiences along the way.  Whenever I think back about my career in particular, I can trace back my current success to a single turning point.  It gives me a chuckle with how it happened.

I was working as a temp in an entry-level DBA position at Capital One.  I didn't have benefits, made significantly less than pretty much everyone around me, but I did enjoy the experience I was getting and the work I was doing.  There was a database contracting company (small company 2-3 employees I think) that also did work with the department I was in.  One day I saw that they had posted a job opening but it was a month or two old.  I wrote in and passed along my resume anyhow.  The owner, which I had met at Capital One before, responded back saying he had already filled the position but was happy to hear I was looking and he would keep me in mind.

Within a day or two he contacted me and told me about a position at the Greater Richmond Chamber of Commerce for a Database Administrator.  He referred me over to them and put in a good word for me.  The funny part of this story is the main reason he was helping me was because he wanted me to stop stealing work from him at Capital One ;)  I think he saw it as an opportunity to help both of us out.  I was able to move into a salaried position with nice benefits at a great non-profit, and he was able to remove me from Capital One.  He basically opened a door for me that I hadn't been able to open on my own so far and it vastly changed my life.

From there I have continued to work through different jobs and have been able to work on all kinds of projects from databases, to pieces of ACDC.com.  Not too shabby if you ask me.  I'm proud of what I've achieved and I would say that given how hard I've had to work for it, I would say I adequately appreciate the things I have as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The worst thing about the iPhone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past couple of months I have been busy consolidating my media from across multiple computers to a single Mac Mini.  In general the process has been great.  With home sharing it's been easy to transfer all of my music, movies, etc to the Mini and then from there I can have my first gen and second gen AppleTV's play from the single mini.  This has all worked seamlessly.  <!--more-->

I decided since I had moved all of my media to this one computer, it would be nice if I could just use it to sync my various devices.  I have an iPod Nano, classic iPod and an iPhone 4.  The Nano and Classic iPod's were no big deal.  It's stupid that they required a wipe before I could sync them to the Mini, but it wasn't too big of a deal since the Mini had all the media that was on them anyway and it was just music which the iPod's would take care of arranging into Albums/Artists/etc for me.

Then came time for syncing my iPhone.  Previously I've been syncing it to a MacBook that I am considering getting rid of.  Regardless, I don't use that MacBook very much these days and it was annoying to have to bring it out to back up my iPhone and transfer any new purchases.

What I really can't understand is why on earth I can't sync my iPhone to other computers where I'm logged in with the same damn Apple ID.  Instead of it being easy, I'm having to completely erase my iPhone and then sync all the stuff that was already on there (apps, music, etc) and then go through the painful process of re-arranging all my apps, etc.

It just doesn't make sense.  For everything Apple does right with their products, this is a huge gaping hole in my opinion that they've ignored since the first iPhone came out.  I hope all the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/21/apples-cloud-music-service-ready-for-launch/" target="_blank">talk about this possible cloud syncing service</a> comes true and remedies this issue, but if it doesn't then that will truly be sad.  There's just no reason I can't sync my iPhone to any one of my computers, especially if they're all signed in under the same iTunes account.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/cloud-heart.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5934" title="cloud-heart" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/cloud-heart.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="109" /></a>After last weeks Amazon Web Services (AWS) issues, everyone is talking a lot about "The Cloud" and whether it's the right answer for many companies.  I'm a pretty big fan of virtual servers, but I can't say that they are for everyone.  When designing any sort of environment I would say there are some, what should seem simple, ideas to keep in mind:  <!--more-->

<em>Know your uptime requirements:</em>
Can your business/website withstand being down for 6-12 hours?  I would say most can, probably far more than think they could.  Some organizations over architect their environments because brief amounts of downtime are unpalatable to them when the simple fact is their users will forgive temporary downtime as long as it doesn't become the norm.  Regardless, your organization needs to figure out what your uptime requirements are and architect to those requirements.  If you need extreme amounts of uptime then you need servers/services spread across multiple availability zones if you're with a single provider, and you possibly need to have services in place across multiple providers so you can recover as quickly as possible if something does go wrong.  How far you need to take this will all be determined by your requirements and help you create your Plan B for when things take a turn for the worse.

<em>Have a Plan B:</em>
Once you have your uptime requirements in place, you can start formulating a Plan B.  This might include using your load balancer to point at a different availability zone, or it might mean quick DNS changes to point your site to a back-up provider.  Short of that though you need to test failures at a lower level.  What if just one of your UI servers dies, what happens?  Hopefully your application can easily sustain something like this and requests quickly re-route to another server.  Similarly, hopefully the services that your UI servers talk to can easily handle single failures like this.

<em>Test your Plan B:</em>
<strong>This is important.</strong>  Make sure that things behave how you expect them to.  Shut down one of your UI servers, or your back-end services.  Do things react how you planned?  If not, then fix it so that they do.  What you do not want to have happen is you end up in a situation where your server has failed and brought your site down or your provider starts having cascading failures and you are at the mercy of their email support.  If your plan does all work as planned then great!  Test it periodically and fix things when they come up (you will need to make corrections to your plan as your service grows!), then you can rest easier at night.

At this point you might find yourself wondering about cost, complexity, etc.  I saw a tweet recently that I related to these thoughts:

http://twitter.com/#!/kylecordes/status/61540471767449601

I'm not sure of his exact meaning here but how I interpreted it brings me back to my first point, knowing your requirements.  The cloud is not necessarily inexpensive and is often more complex then having a simpler set up with a dedicated server or two hosted with your favorite provider.  Design for your needs at the time and adapt as they change over time.  You might be just fine hosting in a small environment and keeping good backups that you can restore to another server and/or provider if needed.

You are keeping backups of your data, aren't you?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Totally agree on the "problems of scalability" point. Most uptime requirements are ridiculous and their exaggeration sort of fuels an arms race where everybody assumes you're not serious unless you have 5 9s availability.

The real drag is that most sites should be thinking about scalability from more than the narrow infrastructure pov. True scalability means you have a business model designed so that, as your usage increases, your funds increase, so that the business sort of self-scales. Cloud providers like AWS can help here, but they also impel people to overarchitect before the business model is proven.

Let's also keep in mind that many who experienced outages were on the cloud because it's cheap, and they were not using it's larger capabilities for availability.]]></wp:comment_content>

Obviously I agree with pretty much all of your points based on my post.  I'd second you on this point.  As I said above, Cloud computing is not necessarily cheap.  If you want its advantages in terms of scaling and reliability, then you're going to need to invest in order to take advantage of those pieces.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Interesting use of Twitter Lists</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was checking out Lists created by others, Lists I'm on, etc. when I realized I was on an interesting, if a little embarrassing, List created by <a href="http://twitter.com/alexkingorg" target="_blank">@alexkingorg</a>.

<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/screen-shot-2011-04-27-at-8-59-12-pm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5786" title="Screen shot 2011-04-27 at 8.59.12 PM" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/screen-shot-2011-04-27-at-8-59-12-pm.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="232" /></a>

To the best of my knowledge, I've only done this for Dropbox, so I will admit I'm guilty here.  I've never really thought about using Lists like this on Twitter however and I am considering giving it a try.  I go up and down in the number of people I'm following and noise is a huge problem on Twitter for me.  There are folks where I enjoy nearly all of their tweets, and there are others that I probably only read about half because the other half are things like FourSquare updates.  I would be curious to find out whether this would help me weed out the folks that annoy me often and that I forget about for whatever reason while culling who I'm following.]]></content:encoded>

List rock, but I would not let someone find out what list they are on, at that point you might as well just delete them, once they find out that you found out that you think they are annoying.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dreamstime_xs_11573169.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-5931 alignleft" title="dreamstime_xs_11573169" src="http://mwalters8.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/dreamstime_xs_11573169-e1309993283116.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="99" /></a>I have had programming language debates in the past.  I've recently been having similar discussions and realized some things.  Arguing one language against another is a religious debate that will never be won.  I realized it wasn't about #winning.  It would be more valuable to change the discussion to why I chose PHP and continue developing with it to this day.<!--more-->

Total disclosure, one of the key reasons I chose PHP originally was because it was easy to find an inexpensive web host that supported it.  In fact the web host I was using at the time already supported it.  I didn't have to worry about licensing fee's, there were many hosts supporting it, and I was already using web applications built on it.  Those are pretty simple reasons, and certainly reasons that could have changed over time.  For instance, unlike when I was 20 and learning PHP, these days I could afford the licensing fee's if I chose to.  The key thing that has kept me with PHP is the documentation and community.

The documentation for PHP itself is unrivaled with other languages from what I've seen.  PHP.net is a fantastic learning resource and was a huge help when I was getting started.  I could easily browse available functions, and didn't need to search across tons of blogs for likely out of date information.  If I needed to sort an array I could look up sort() and as well as providing me the syntax/parameters, at the bottom of the page it would list other array sorting functions which I could check to see if they better met my needs based on what I was doing in my application.  This matured documentation also exists in other places within PHP.  For example in WordPress, the documentation is fairly strong.  It's not always completely up to date, but the fact it's as comprehensive as it is places it head and shoulders above many other open source programs.

The community is definitely the key feature for me with PHP.  I find it both welcoming and accepting of various skill levels.  I find folks in the PHP community commonly focus on getting stuff done and eagerly teach and share with each other.  There's not much meaningless focus on academic debates or pontificating to boost one's own ego.  That's not to say those things never happens in the PHP community, but I find it happening less often in the world of PHP.

I'm not entirely sure why lots of folks like to consider PHP the red-headed stepchild of web development, but they do.  When developers of other languages do start attacking PHP or my use of it, they're usually just reminding me of why I like my choice of PHP in the first place.  It would probably be a more meaningful discussion for all of us if they'd instead try to show me why they chose their preferred language instead of trying to compare it feature for feature with PHP and simply answering my questions while respectfully understanding if I don't agree about whether I should be using their preferred language.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well as I mentioned, my initial choice of PHP was for pretty simple reasons.  It was free and my current web host supported it and I found the documentation to be great.

As for the community, it welcomed me, helped me, and taught me.  So I would say the community did help me to choose the language.  Perhaps not before I hacked together my first few lines of PHP code, but I would say my appreciation of the community started so early on that it would be difficult to say it didn't factor at all into my decision.  The main documentation site for PHP is itself fairly community driven (see comments section below any documentation page).  So I had little choice but to feel involved in the community from the very start when I read my first piece of documentation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Red-headed stepchild? More like granddaddy. Other than Perl, I can't think of a language more fundamental to web applications.

I hear what you're saying about the PHP community, but did it really factor into your decision to adopt PHP initially? I mean, I feel similarly about the Ruby community, but I honestly can't say that it helped me _choose_ the language, because I didn't really understand the scope of resources and guidance the community makes available till after I had acclimated myself to the language. YMMV, but for me I think the community helped me _stay_ with the language, and not simply abandon it when I got stuck in a really hairy problem.

Ultimately, all languages get reputations that end up not being universally true or not keeping up with the times, so I look askance at people who reject languages without having a background in them. PHP is no longer a language for spaghetti within markup; it now has classes. Ruby is no longer super slow; it now has real threads. I'm forced to conclude that there are specious reasons for language choices most of the time; few of us really invest in one language or another without being directed to do so by a boss or a project. The key is: do you stick with the language, or do you move on to the next big thing?]]></wp:comment_content>

It is nice having a hobby project to work on again and the opportunity to play with some of the new development tools I've been itching to try, but had a lack of purpose to use.  As <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/07/05/new-service-idea/#comment-509">I mentioned</a>, the project has to do with data storage and (what I think are) new ways to use that data and manipulate that data.  I'll try being less vague in the near future, but until some more things coalesce in my head, I'd prefer to not dive in too much on detail.]]></content:encoded>

I feel sort of hokey saying that, but the main reason I feel sad is that he didn't get more time to spend with his family after leaving Apple.

I thank him greatly for his contributions to the things I enjoy in my everyday life but I'd gladly give it all up if he could have another day with his family.

He'll be greatly missed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Carrie and I decided to host Thanksgiving again this year.  We did this last year but our parents basically cooked everything and brought it here for us all to eat.  This year it will be us and my parents, but we've decided to do the Turkey and dessert courses.  Hopefully this will go well, although this conversation did take place earlier this evening:
<blockquote>Me: Are we going to have to yank out the insides?
<a title="Carrie on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/carriefleck" target="_blank"> Carrie</a>: If by "we" you mean you, then yes.
Me: Let's make chicken.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've done the Year In Review posts for a while now, so here's your next installment :)
<h3>Work</h3>
I'm still working at <a title="Snagajob" href="http://www.snagajob.com/" target="_blank">Snagajob</a>.  Things are going well.  This year we received the #1 small business to work for award and had <a title="Governor McDonnell visits Snagajob" href="http://youtu.be/c-YaPGD5LTo" target="_blank">Governor McDonnell visit us</a>.  There were <a title="Snagger Outtakes" href="http://youtu.be/c5EjjhOU40w" target="_blank">some</a> other <a href="http://youtu.be/4arh94UzwzY" target="_blank">moments</a> that <a href="http://youtu.be/dyrmmDWuWxg" target="_blank">were</a> quite <a href="http://youtu.be/blVhDDkCxjw" target="_blank">funny</a> throughout the <a href="http://youtu.be/_hZj6Qe1XBI" target="_blank">year</a> as well.  We also showed <a title="Snagger Outtakes" href="http://youtu.be/PhlSRCp3lfw" target="_blank">we're not perfect</a> (that's one of my favorites).

I'm getting to work on some exciting projects that unfortunately I can't talk too much about but I think there is some big stuff in store for our members in 2012 :)
<h3>Personal</h3>
Carrie and I got married on October 8th, 2011.

https://twitter.com/mwalters/status/122850653126131712

The wedding was awesome, the weather was perfect, and we had a great group of family and friends to share the day with.  Shortly after our wedding we left for Kauai on our honeymoon.  We spent 10 days there and I <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/14/6084/">shared</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/16/autograph-tree/">many</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/18/m-c/">many</a> <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/16/oh/">pictures</a> while we were there.  I would say my favorite part of the trip was the snorkeling trip we took which also gave us a boat tour of the <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/17/napali-coast/">Na Pali coast</a>.

A couple of weeks after we got back from Hawaii we adopted our second dog, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/10/30/put-in-an-application-to-hopefully-adopt-this-little-guy/">Marco</a>.  Then not too long after that, <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/11/23/atticus-found-marcos-bed-last-night-marco-15lb-atticus-85lb/">Atticus decided to see if he could fit in Marco's bed</a> (keep in mind, Marco is about 1/5th the size of Atticus).  Marco is full of energy, but every once in a while he tuckers out and it's pretty damn cute when <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2011/11/19/tired-marco/">he does</a>.

That is all probably way to short to really speak to all the exciting things that happened this year but I think it covers the major highlights.  I hope everyone is doing well and has a great holiday.]]></content:encoded>
